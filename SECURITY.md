# Security Policy

At **Copilotkit**, we are continuously working to improve not only the product but also the open-source repository. To achieve this, we encourage you to take some time to responsibly disclose any issues you may encounter.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We hope this product meets your expectations. However, if you notice anything that seems off, please feel free to report the issue by following the steps below:

    - Steps to reproduce the issue
    - Potential impact or risk
    - Any possible mitigations or workarounds

3. **Preferred Method of Disclosure**:

## Response Process

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report, we will acknowledge your submission.
- **Investigation**: We will investigate the issue within 5 business days.
