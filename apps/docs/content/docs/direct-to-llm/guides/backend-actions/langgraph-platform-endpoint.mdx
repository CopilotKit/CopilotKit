  This guide assumes you've created a LangGraph agent, and have a
  `langgraph.json` file set up. If you need a quick introduction, check out
  [this brief example from the LangGraph
  docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) or follow one of our demos.

## Deploy a Graph to LangGraph Platform

<Steps>

    <Step>
    ### Deploy your agent

    First, you need to host your agent so that CopilotKit can access it.

    <LangGraphPlatformDeploymentTabs components={props.components} />
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Setup your Copilot Runtime

    <TailoredContent id="hosting">
        <TailoredContentOption
            id="copilot-cloud"
            title="Copilot Cloud (Recommended)"
            description="I'm already using or want to use Copilot Cloud."
            icon={<FaCloud />}
        >
            If you followed the [Copilot Cloud Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) and opted to use CopilotCloud,
            you only need to add your LangGraph Platform deployment URL and LangSmith API key to your CopilotCloud.

            <Accordions className="my-4">
                <Accordion title="Haven't setup Copilot Cloud yet? Click here!" >
                    Copilot Cloud hooks into your CopilotKit provider, so you'll need to set it up first if you haven't already.
                    <CopilotCloudConfigureCopilotkitProviderSnippet components={props.components} />
                </Accordion>
            </Accordions>
            <CopilotCloudConfigureRemoteEndpointLangGraphSnippet components={props.components} />
        </TailoredContentOption>
        <TailoredContentOption
            id="self-hosted"
            title="Self-Hosted"
            description="I'm using or want to use a self-hosted Copilot Runtime."
            icon={<FaServer />}
        >
            <Steps>
                <Step>
                    <FindCopilotRuntimeSnippet components={props.components} />
                </Step>
                <Step>
                    Update the `CopilotRuntime` config to include the `agents` property:

                    ```tsx
                    import {
                        CopilotRuntime,
                        LangGraphAgent  // [!code highlight]
                        // ...
                    } from "@copilotkit/runtime";

                    const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
                        // ...existing configuration
                        agents: { // [!code highlight:8]
                            // New agent entry per agent you wish to use
                            'my-agent': new LangGraphAgent({
                                deploymentUrl: '<your-api-url>',
                                graphId: '<my-agent>',
                                langsmithApiKey: '<your-langsmith-api-key>' // Optional
                            }),
                        },
                    });
                    ```
                </Step>
            </Steps>
        </TailoredContentOption>
    </TailoredContent>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Test Your Implementation

        After setting up the remote endpoint and modifying your `CopilotRuntime`, you can test your implementation by asking the copilot to perform actions that invoke your agent.<br/>
        The graph and interactions can viewed in [LangGraph Studio](smith.langchain.com/studio) and any logs should be available on [LangSmith](smith.langchain.com)

    </Step>

</Steps>

## Authentication

For production deployments, you'll want to implement proper authentication to ensure users can only access their own data and threads. CopilotKit supports passing user authentication tokens to your LangGraph Platform agents.

<Callout type="info">
  Learn how to implement secure authentication with your LangGraph agents in our
  comprehensive [LangGraph Agent Authentication
  Guide](/coagents/shared/guides/langgraph-platform-authentication).
</Callout>

### Quick Example

Pass authentication tokens through the `properties` prop:

```tsx
<CopilotKit
  runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
  properties={{
    authorization: userToken, // Gets forwarded to LangGraph Platform
  }}
>
  <YourApp />
</CopilotKit>
```

Your LangGraph agent can then access the authentication context:

```python
def authenticate_user(state, config):
    auth_header = config.get("configurable", {}).get("authorization")
    user_info = validate_jwt_token(auth_header)
    # Use user_info to control access and permissions
    return state
```

---

## Troubleshooting

A few things to try if you are running into trouble:

1. Make sure that you listed your agents according to the graphs mentioned in the `langgraph.json` file
2. Make sure the agent names are the same between the agent Python implementation, the `langgraph.json` file and the remote endpoint declaration
3. Make sure the LangGraph Platform deployment has all environment variables listed as you need them to be, according to your agent implementation
4. **Authentication issues**: If you're having trouble with authentication, check that you're passing the `authorization` token in the `properties` prop and that your agent is properly validating it. See the [authentication guide](/coagents/shared/guides/langgraph-platform-authentication) for details.
