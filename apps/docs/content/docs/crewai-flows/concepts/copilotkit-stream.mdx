title: Streaming and Tool Calls
description: CoAgents support streaming your messages and tool calls to the frontend.
---

If you'd like to stream messages from your CrewAI agents you can utilize our Copilotkit SDK which provides a collection
of functions and utilities for interacting with the agent's state or behavior. This allows you to choose how messages and
tool calls are emitted and streamed to the frontend.

## Message Streaming

If you just call the LiteLLM `completion` function from your CrewAI agent, messages will not be streamed by default.
To stream messages, wrap the `completion` function with the `copilotkit_stream` function. This will enable streaming
of both the messages and tool calls to the frontend.

```python
response = copilotkit_stream(
    completion(
        model="openai/gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": my_prompt},
            *self.state["messages"]
        ],
        stream=True
    )
)
```

For more information on how tool calls are utilized check out our [frontend actions](/crewai-flows/frontend-actions)
documentation.
