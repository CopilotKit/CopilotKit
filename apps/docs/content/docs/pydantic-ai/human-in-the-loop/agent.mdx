## What is this?

[Flow based agents](https://docs.pydantic-ai.com/concepts/flows) are stateful agents that can be interrupted and resumed
to allow for user input.

CopilotKit lets you to add custom UI to take user input and then pass it back to the agent upon completion.

## Why should I use this?

Human-in-the-loop is a powerful way to implement complex workflows that are production ready. By having a human in the loop,
you can ensure that the agent is always making the right decisions and ultimately is being steered in the right direction.

Flow based agents are a great way to implement HITL for more complex workflows where you want to ensure the agent is aware
of everything that has happened during a HITL interaction.

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Run and connect your agent

        You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding. If you haven't done so already,
        you can follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](/pydantic-ai/quickstart/pydantic-ai) guide.

        If you don't already have an agent, you can use the [coagent starter](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/examples/coagents-starter-pydantic-ai) as a starting point
        as this guide uses it as a starting point.

    <Step>
      ### Install the CopilotKit SDK
      <InstallSDKSnippet components={props.components}/>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Add a `useCopilotAction` to your Frontend
        First, we'll create a component that renders the agent's essay draft and waits for user approval.

        ```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
        import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core"
        import { Markdown } from "@copilotkit/react-ui"

        function YourMainContent() {
          // ...

          useCopilotAction({
            name: "write_essay",
            available: "frontend",
            description: "Writes an essay and takes the draft as an argument.",
            parameters: [
              { name: "draft", type: "string", description: "The draft of the essay", required: true },
            ],
            // [!code highlight:25]
            renderAndWaitForResponse: ({ args, respond, status }) => {
              return (
                <div>
                  <Markdown content={args.draft || 'Preparing your draft...'} />

                  <div className={`flex gap-4 pt-4 ${status !== "executing" ? "hidden" : ""}`}>
                    <button
                      onClick={() => respond?.("CANCEL")}
                      disabled={status !== "executing"}
                      className="border p-2 rounded-xl w-full"
                    >
                      Try Again
                    </button>
                    <button
                      onClick={() => respond?.("SEND")}
                      disabled={status !== "executing"}
                      className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded-xl w-full"
                    >
                      Approve Draft
                    </button>
                  </div>
                </div>
              );
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Setup the Pydantic AI Agent
Now we'll setup the Pydantic AI agent. The flow is hard to understand without a complete example, so below
    is the complete implementation of the agent with explanations.

    Some main things to note:
    - The agent's state inherits from `CopilotKitState` to bring in the CopilotKit actions.
    - CopilotKit's actions are bound to the model as tools.
    - If the `writeEssay` action is found in the model's response, the agent will pass control back to the frontend
      to get user feedback.

    <Tabs groupId="language" items={["Python"]}>
      <Tab value="Python">
        ```python title="agent/sample_agent/agent.py"
        from pydantic_ai import Agent

        agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o-mini')

        @agent.tool_plain
        async def write_essay(topic: str) -> str:
            """Write an essay on the given topic."""
            # This would typically generate an essay
            # The agent will wait for user feedback before proceeding
            return f"Essay draft on '{topic}' has been generated. Please review."

        app = agent.to_ag_ui()
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        Try asking your agent to write an essay about the benefits of AI. You'll see that it will generate an essay,
        stream the progress and eventually ask you to review it.
