title: Anonymous Telemetry
---

We use anonymous telemetry (metadata-only) to learn how to improve CopilotKit.

* Open-source telemetry is **completely anonymous** 
* We **do not collect any data** about end-users (the users interacting with your copilot)
* We **do not collect any application data** flowing through your system, only CopilotKit metadata
* We do not sell or share any data with third parties
* We do not use cookies or trackers in open-source telemetry
* To minimize the frequency of data sent, we apply batching and sampling to telemetry

## How to opt out of anonymous telemetry

You can opt out of open-source telemetry in multiple ways.

In CopilotRuntime, simply set `COPILOTKIT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=true`. We also respect [Do Not Track (DNT)](https://consoledonottrack.com/).

Alternatively, you can directly set the `telemetryDisabled` flag to `true` when configuring your Copilot Runtime endpoint.

## How to adjust telemetry sample rate

The default sample rate is `0.05` (5%). You can adjust it by setting the `COPILOTKIT_TELEMETRY_SAMPLE_RATE` to any value between 0 and 1.
