In this guide, we'll teach you how to link the CopilotKit packages to your own project to test your changes. This way, you can run `turbo run dev` in the CopilotKit monorepo, and see changes in your own project immediately.

## Global Package Linking With `pnpm`

We will use pnpm's [global linking feature](https://pnpm.io/cli/link#pnpm-link---global) to link the CopilotKit packages to your own project.

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### In The CopilotKit Monorepo
  Assuming you followed all steps in the contribution guide guide, you should have everything set up properly and ready to go.

  Navigate to the CopilotKit monorepo and run the following command to link the packages globally:

  ```bash
  turbo run link:global
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### In Your Project
  In your project, ensure you have pnpm configured. This will not prevent you from using npm or yarn as well. But for the purpose of global linking, you must use pnpm.

  ```bash
  cd your-project
  pnpm i
  ```

  Next, link the desired package in your project:
  ```bash
  # For example, to link the @copilotkit/react-core package:
  pnpm link --global @copilotkit/react-core
  ```

  You can run this for all packages, or just the ones you need. Your changes will now be synced.
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Unlinking
  Once you are done, you can undo the global linking by running the following command in the CopilotKit monorepo:

  ```bash
  turbo run unlink:global
  ```

  And then in your project:
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```

  That's it, everything is now back to normal!
  </Step>
