# Architecture

How `@copilotkit/bot-slack` is structured and **why** each boundary exists.

This package is the Slack `PlatformAdapter` for [`@copilotkit/bot`](../bot).
The bot engine owns the platform-agnostic orchestration (handlers, the
run/tool/interrupt loop, JSX action binding, the `ActionStore`); this package
owns everything Slack-specific: Bolt ingress, Block Kit egress, streaming,
and opaque-id interactions.

## Design goals

1. **The agent doesn't know about Slack.** It receives ordinary AG-UI input
   and emits ordinary AG-UI events.
2. **Slack mechanics don't bleed into the engine.** `chat.update` throttling,
   mrkdwn translation, chunking, interrupt capture, and `block_actions`
   routing all live behind the `PlatformAdapter` interface.
3. **One file, one job.** Each source file has a single responsibility.
4. **Failures are contained.** A failed `chat.update` doesn't crash the run.
5. **No durable Slack-side state.** Slack is the source of truth
   (`conversations.replies` / `conversations.history`); the conversation
   store reconstructs each turn's `agent.messages` from Slack on the fly.

## The boundary: `PlatformAdapter`

`SlackAdapter` (constructed via `slack(opts)`) implements
`@copilotkit/bot`'s `PlatformAdapter`. The members it implements:

- `platform`, `capabilities` (`supportsStreaming: true`, modals/typing/
  reactions `false`, `maxBlocksPerMessage: 50`), `ackDeadlineMs` (3000)
- `start(sink)` / `stop()` — bring the Bolt app up / down and push normalized
  events into the engine's `IngressSink`
- `render(ir)` — IR → Block Kit (`renderBlockKit`)
- `post` / `update` / `stream` / `delete` — egress via the Slack Web client
- `createRunRenderer(target)` — the AG-UI `RunRenderer` for a run
- `decodeInteraction(raw)` — native `block_actions` payload → `InteractionEvent`
- `lookupUser(query)` — directory search for `@`-mention resolution
  (backs `thread.lookupUser`)
- `getMessages(target)` — the thread's messages via `conversations.replies`
  (backs `thread.getMessages`)
- `postFile(target, args)` — upload a file via `files.uploadV2`
  (backs `thread.postFile`)
- `conversationStore` — Slack-backed `getOrCreate` → `AgentSession`

The engine drives ingress through the `IngressSink` it hands to `start`
(`sink.onTurn` / `sink.onInteraction`) and egress through these methods.

```

### Ingress

`attachSlackListener` is the translation layer between Slack's event model
and the engine's domain. It filters subtypes, bot echoes, untracked threads,
and mention duplicates, and emits a normalized turn. The adapter resolves the
sender to a `PlatformUser` (cached per id) and calls `sink.onTurn` with a
`conversationKey` (`conversationKeyOf`), `replyTarget`, `userText`, and
`user`.

### Run / render

`thread.runAgent` resolves the conversation's `AgentSession` from the
`conversationStore`, creates `createRunRenderer(target)`, and runs
`runAgentLoop`. The renderer (`event-renderer.ts`) subscribes to AG-UI
events: it lazily creates a stream on the first `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`,
accumulates deltas, optionally surfaces `:wrench:` / `:white_check_mark:`
tool-status rows (`showToolStatus`), and captures frontend tool calls and
`on_interrupt` custom events for the loop to read after each `runAgent`.

### Tools

When the agent calls a registered frontend tool, the loop validates the args
(Standard Schema) and invokes `tool.handler(args, ctx)`. `ctx` is the single
shared `BotToolContext` (`{ thread, message?, user?, signal?, platform }`) —
there is no Slack-specific context. Slack power is reached only through
capability-gated `thread` methods the adapter backs (`getMessages`,
`lookupUser`, `postFile`). A render-tool handler renders JSX with
`thread.post(<Card .../>)`, which goes through the engine's action-binding
then `renderSlackMessage` / `renderBlockKit` → Block Kit.

### HITL & interrupts

`thread.awaitChoice(<Picker .../>)` posts a picker and blocks the engine's
waiter until a click in that conversation resolves it. A captured agent
interrupt is dispatched to the registered `onInterrupt` handler, which posts a
picker whose button `onClick` calls `thread.resume(value)`; the loop
re-enters with `forwardedProps.command`.

### Interactions

`app.action(/.*/)` acks every click within ≤3s, then `decodeInteraction`
pulls the opaque minted id (`ck:…`), any tiny `bind()` value, and the message
ref out of the `block_actions` payload, building an `InteractionEvent`. The
engine resolves it: an awaiting HITL waiter, or `ActionRegistry.dispatch` —
a hot-cache hit, or a **cold-path re-render rehydration** (load the snapshot,
re-render the named component with frozen props, re-walk to the handler's
path). A miss after restart degrades to "this action expired."

## Preserved mechanics

These files carry over from the pre-rework package, lightly adapted:

| File                        | Job                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slack-listener.ts`         | Slack events → normalized turns; ingress filters.                       |
| `conversation-store.ts`     | Slack-backed history reconstruction; folds chunked bot replies.         |
| `message-stream.ts`         | Per-message `chat.update` queue + ≥800ms throttle (no update races).    |
| `chunked-message-stream.ts` | Multi-message chunking; keeps fenced blocks whole; per-chunk transform. |
| `auto-close-streaming.ts`   | Closes dangling markdown brackets mid-stream (idempotent).              |
| `markdown-to-mrkdwn.ts`     | GFM Markdown → Slack mrkdwn; column-aligns tables in a fence.           |
| `download-files.ts`         | Inbound file download → AG-UI multimodal content parts.                 |
| `sanitizing-http-agent.ts`  | HTTP agent that sanitizes outbound requests to the AG-UI backend.       |

## What's intentionally _not_ abstracted

- **No abstraction over Bolt.** If you use this package, you're talking to
  Slack.
- **No durable Slack-side state.** The next turn rebuilds context from Slack
  history; restarts are safe for conversation history by construction.
  (The engine's `ActionStore` is separately in-memory in v1, so inline
  interaction handlers expire on restart — see the `@copilotkit/bot` README.)
