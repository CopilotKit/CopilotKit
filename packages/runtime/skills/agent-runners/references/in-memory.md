InMemoryAgentRunner — default ephemeral runner. Keyed on a `globalThis` Symbol so thread state survives hot-module reloads during development.

## Store layout

```typescript
// packages/runtime/src/v2/runtime/runner/in-memory.ts
const GLOBAL_STORE_KEY = Symbol.for("@copilotkit/runtime/in-memory-store");

interface GlobalStoreData {
  stores: Map<string, InMemoryEventStore>; // per-threadId
  historicRunsBackup: Map<string, HistoricRun[]>; // restored after HMR
}
```

One `InMemoryEventStore` per `threadId`. Each store tracks:

- `subject: ReplaySubject<BaseEvent> | null` — current consumers
- `isRunning: boolean` — gate for the `"Thread already running"` throw
- `currentRunId: string | null`
- `historicRuns: HistoricRun[]` — completed runs (backed up across HMR)
- `agent: AbstractAgent | null` — the instance that owns the active run
- `runSubject`, `currentEvents`, `stopRequested`

## Lifecycle

1. `run({ threadId, agent, input })` — if `store.isRunning` throw `Error("Thread already running")`. Otherwise create a `ReplaySubject`, subscribe to `agent.run(input)`, push events into the subject, track them in `currentEvents`, mark the store `isRunning`.
2. On `RunFinishedEvent` / `RunErrorEvent`: finalize the run, push its events into `historicRuns`, clear `isRunning`, `currentRunId`, `agent`.
3. `connect({ threadId })` — returns a `ReplaySubject` that replays the active run events or (if no active run) the most recent historic run.
4. `stop({ threadId })` — sets `stopRequested = true`; the active subscription checks the flag on each event and tears down.

## Hot reload (development)

In dev, bundlers replace modules. `GLOBAL_STORE_KEY` uses `Symbol.for(...)` so the same well-known symbol is reused across module instances — `globalThis[KEY]` survives. On module re-evaluation, if the `stores` map is empty but `historicRunsBackup` still has entries, the runner rehydrates historic-only stores from the backup (active runs are lost, historic runs come back).

## When NOT to use

- Multi-instance production deploys — each process has its own store.
- Long-lived servers — restart wipes active threads (historic runs are only preserved in the HMR-dev backup, not across process exit).
- Load-balanced serverless with cold starts — new workers see empty stores.

## When it is OK

- Local development.
- Single-instance preview environments.
- Tests (each `new InMemoryAgentRunner()` still shares the globalThis store — pass a fresh threadId per test, or clear the Symbol-keyed global between tests).
