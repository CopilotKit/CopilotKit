/**
 * Error message configuration - Single source of truth for all error messages
 *
 * This centralized configuration system provides:
 *
 * üéØ **Benefits:**
 * - Single source of truth for all error messages
 * - Easy content management without touching code
 * - Consistent error messaging across the application
 * - Ready for internationalization (i18n)
 * - Type-safe configuration with TypeScript
 * - Categorized errors for better handling
 *
 * üìù **How to use:**
 * 1. Add new error patterns to `errorPatterns` object
 * 2. Use {context} placeholder for dynamic context injection
 * 3. Specify category, severity, and actionable flags
 * 4. Add fallback messages for error categories
 *
 * üîß **How to maintain:**
 * - Content teams can update messages here without touching logic
 * - Developers add new error patterns as needed
 * - Use categories to group similar errors
 * - Mark errors as actionable if users can fix them
 *
 * üåç **Future i18n support:**
 * - Replace `message` string with `messages: { en: "...", es: "..." }`
 * - Add locale parameter to helper functions
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Adding a new error pattern:
 * "CUSTOM_ERROR": {
 *   message: "Custom error occurred in {context}. Please try again.",
 *   category: "unknown",
 *   severity: "error",
 *   actionable: true
 * }
 * ```
