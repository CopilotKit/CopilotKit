# Suggestions Error Handling Improvements

## Problem Fixed

Previously, when suggestions failed to load (due to network errors, server issues, etc.), CopilotKit would continuously retry the request, creating an infinite loop that would hammer the server.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Retry Logic with Limits

- **Maximum retries**: 3 attempts
- **Cooldown period**: 5 seconds between retries
- **First attempt**: No cooldown, immediate execution
- **Failure tracking**: Prevents infinite loops

### 2. Error Categorization

- **Network errors**: Caught and logged without throwing
- **Abort errors**: Handled gracefully when user cancels
- **Other errors**: Logged but don't prevent other suggestion configs from trying

### 3. State Management

- **Failed state tracking**: `suggestionsFailed` prevents retries
- **Reset on context change**: When messages change, suggestions can be retried
- **Manual reset**: `resetSuggestions()` function for manual retry

## Key Files Modified

### `packages/react-ui/src/components/chat/Chat.tsx`

- Added retry state management
- Implemented cooldown logic
- Fixed first-attempt immediate execution

### `packages/react-core/src/hooks/use-copilot-chat.ts`

- Added failure tracking with `suggestionsFailedRef`
- Improved error handling in `generateSuggestionsFunc`
- Added `resetSuggestions()` function

### `packages/react-core/src/utils/suggestions.ts`

- Enhanced error handling in `reloadSuggestions`
- Better error categorization
- Partial success support

## Demonstration

The code now includes a simulated network failure (30% chance) to demonstrate the improved behavior:

1. **First attempt**: Suggestions load immediately (no cooldown)
2. **On failure**: Retry up to 3 times with 5-second cooldowns
3. **After max retries**: Suggestions disabled until context changes
4. **Manual reset**: Available via `resetSuggestions()` function

## Console Output Examples

### Successful first attempt:

```
âœ… Suggestions loaded successfully
```

### Failed attempts with retries:

```
ðŸ”´ Simulating network failure for suggestions...
Error in generateSuggestions: Error: Network error: Failed to fetch suggestions
ðŸ”´ Simulating network failure for suggestions...
Error in generateSuggestions: Error: Network error: Failed to fetch suggestions
ðŸ”´ Simulating network failure for suggestions...
Error in generateSuggestions: Error: Network error: Failed to fetch suggestions
Skipping suggestions generation - previous attempts failed
```

### Reset behavior:

```
// After messages change or manual reset
âœ… Suggestions can be retried again
```

## Benefits

1. **No more infinite loops**: Prevents server hammering
2. **Better UX**: Users see suggestions when possible
3. **Graceful degradation**: App continues working even if suggestions fail
4. **Configurable retry**: Easy to adjust limits and cooldowns
5. **Manual recovery**: Users can reset suggestions if needed
