In this project, I developed a Task Manager using React for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Shadcn UI for enhanced UI components.

- User can add Task using form with its detail description, date & time and also needs to add priority of task.
- User also show task completed as well as delete the task.

- User need to write task name,task details also update and delete the task.
