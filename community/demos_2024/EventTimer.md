# Event Timer with Copilot Bot
In this project, I developed an Event Countdown Timer with Copilot Bot integration using React for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and the CopilotKit for interactive guidance and suggestions.

- Event Timer: Users can add an event with a specific target date and time. The app displays a countdown for the event, and users can manage multiple events by adding or removing them from the list.
- Copilot Bot Integration: The app is integrated with Copilot Bot to assist users with instructions on how to set timers, offering help for timer creation in a user-friendly way.
