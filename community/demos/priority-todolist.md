# 1. TO-DO List with Prioritization
In this project, I developed a TO-DO List with Prioritization using React for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Shadcn UI for enhanced UI components.
### Method 1 - Using Form
- User can add Task using form with its detail description, date & time and also needs to add priority of task.
- User also show task completed as well as delete the task.
### Method 2 - Using Copilotkit
- User need to write task name,task details, due date and time as well as priority of task.
