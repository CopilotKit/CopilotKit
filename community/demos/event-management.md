# Event management with Copilot Bot
In this project, I developed an Event management with Copilot Bot integration using Next Js for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for styling, and the CopilotKit for interactive guidance and suggestions.

- Event Calendar: Users can add an event in a specific target date and time. The app displays a calendar view where users can add event , and users can manage multiple events by adding or removing them from the list.
- Copilot Bot Integration: The app is integrated with Copilot Bot to assist users with instructions on how to add an event , offering help for planning event in a user-friendly way.
