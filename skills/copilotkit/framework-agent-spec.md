# Open Agent Spec Integration

CopilotKit implementation guide for Open Agent Spec.

## Guidance
### AG-UI
- Route: `/agent-spec/ag-ui`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/ag-ui.mdx`
- Description: The AG-UI protocol connects your frontend to your Agent Spec agents via event-based Server-Sent Events (SSE).

CopilotKit is built on the [AG-UI protocol](https://ag-ui.com) — a lightweight, event-based standard that defines how AI agents communicate with user-facing applications over Server-Sent Events (SSE).

Everything in CopilotKit — messages, state updates, tool calls, and more — flows through AG-UI events. Understanding this layer helps you debug, extend, and build on top of CopilotKit more effectively.

## Accessing Your Agent with `useAgent`

The `useAgent` hook is your primary interface to the AG-UI agent powering your copilot. It returns an [`AbstractAgent`](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/blob/main/typescript/packages/client/src/agents/abstract-agent.ts) from the AG-UI client library — the same base type that all AG-UI agents implement.

```tsx
import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

function MyComponent() {
  const { agent } = useAgent();

  // agent.messages - conversation history
  // agent.state - current agent state
  // agent.isRunning - whether the agent is currently running
}
```

If you have multiple agents, pass the `agentId` to select one:

```tsx
const { agent } = useAgent({ agentId: "research-agent" });
```

The returned `agent` is a standard AG-UI `AbstractAgent`. You can subscribe to its events, read its state, and interact with it using the same interface defined by the [AG-UI specification](https://docs.ag-ui.com).

### Subscribing to AG-UI Events

Every agent exposes a `subscribe` method that lets you listen for specific AG-UI events as they stream in. Each callback receives the event and the current agent state:

```tsx
import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import { useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { agent } = useAgent();

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = agent.subscribe({
      // Called on every event
      onEvent({ event, agent }) {
        console.log("Event:", event.type, event);
      },

      // Text message streaming
      onTextMessageContentEvent({ event, textMessageBuffer, agent }) {
        console.log("Streaming text:", textMessageBuffer);
      },

      // Tool calls
      onToolCallEndEvent({ event, toolCallName, toolCallArgs, agent }) {
        console.log("Tool called:", toolCallName, toolCallArgs);
      },

      // State updates
      onStateSnapshotEvent({ event, agent }) {
        console.log("State snapshot:", agent.state);
      },

      // High-level lifecycle
      onMessagesChanged({ agent }) {
        console.log("Messages updated:", agent.messages);
      },
      onStateChanged({ agent }) {
        console.log("State changed:", agent.state);
      },
    });

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
  }, [agent]);
}
```

The full list of subscribable events maps directly to the [AG-UI event types](https://docs.ag-ui.com/concepts/events):

| Event | Callback | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run lifecycle | `onRunStartedEvent`, `onRunFinishedEvent`, `onRunErrorEvent` | Agent run start, completion, and errors |
| Steps | `onStepStartedEvent`, `onStepFinishedEvent` | Individual step boundaries within a run |
| Text messages | `onTextMessageStartEvent`, `onTextMessageContentEvent`, `onTextMessageEndEvent` | Streaming text content from the agent |
| Tool calls | `onToolCallStartEvent`, `onToolCallArgsEvent`, `onToolCallEndEvent`, `onToolCallResultEvent` | Tool invocation lifecycle |
| State | `onStateSnapshotEvent`, `onStateDeltaEvent` | Full state snapshots and incremental deltas |
| Messages | `onMessagesSnapshotEvent` | Full message list snapshots |
| Custom | `onCustomEvent`, `onRawEvent` | Custom and raw events for extensibility |
| High-level | `onMessagesChanged`, `onStateChanged` | Aggregate notifications after any message or state mutation |

## The Proxy Pattern

When you use CopilotKit with a runtime, your frontend never talks directly to your agent. Instead, CopilotKit creates a **proxy agent** on the frontend that forwards requests through the Copilot Runtime.

On startup, CopilotKit calls the runtime's `/info` endpoint to discover which agents are available. Each agent is wrapped in a `ProxiedCopilotRuntimeAgent` — a thin client that extends AG-UI's [`HttpAgent`](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/blob/main/typescript/packages/client/src/agents/http-agent.ts). From your component's perspective, this proxy behaves identically to a local AG-UI agent: same `AbstractAgent` interface, same subscribe API, same properties. But under the hood, every `run` call is an HTTP request to your server, and every response is an SSE stream of AG-UI events flowing back.

```tsx title="What your component sees"
const { agent } = useAgent(); // Returns an AbstractAgent
agent.messages;               // Read messages
agent.state;                  // Read state
agent.subscribe({ ... });     // Subscribe to events
```

```tsx title="What actually happens"
// useAgent() → AgentRegistry checks /info → wraps each agent in ProxiedCopilotRuntimeAgent
// agent.runAgent() → HTTP POST to runtime → runtime routes to your agent → SSE stream back
```

This indirection is what enables the runtime to provide authentication, middleware, agent routing, and ecosystem features like [threads](/premium/threads) and [observability](/premium/observability) — without changing how you interact with agents on the frontend.

## How Agents Slot into the Runtime

On the server side, the `CopilotRuntime` accepts a map of AG-UI `AbstractAgent` instances. Each agent framework provides its own implementation, but they all extend the same base type:

```ts title="app/api/copilotkit/route.ts"
import { CopilotRuntime, copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint } from "@copilotkit/runtime";
import { HttpAgent } from "@ag-ui/client";

const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  agents: {
    "my-agent": new HttpAgent({
      url: "https://my-agent-server.example.com",
    }),
  },
});

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
    runtime,
    endpoint: "/api/copilotkit",
  });
  return handleRequest(req);
};
```

When a request comes in:

1. The runtime resolves the target agent by ID
2. It clones the agent (for thread safety) and sets messages, state, and thread context from the request
3. The `AgentRunner` executes the agent, which produces a stream of AG-UI `BaseEvent`s
4. Events are encoded as SSE and streamed back to the frontend proxy

Because every agent is an `AbstractAgent`, you can register any AG-UI-compatible agent — whether it's an `HttpAgent` pointing at a remote server, a framework-specific adapter, or a custom implementation — and the runtime handles routing, middleware, and delivery uniformly.

### Coding Agents
- Route: `/agent-spec/coding-agents`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/coding-agents.mdx`
- Description: Use our MCP server to connect your Agent Spec agents to CopilotKit.

## Overview
The CopilotKit MCP server equips AI coding agents with deep knowledge about CopilotKit's APIs, patterns, and best practices. When connected to your
development environment, it enables AI assistants to:
- Provide expert guidance
- Generate accurate code
- Give your AI agents a user interface
- Help you implement CopilotKit features correctly

Powered by 🪄 [Tadata](https://tadata.com) - The platform for instantly building and hosting MCP servers.

## GitHub Copilot

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) is Microsoft's AI pair programmer integrated into VS Code and other editors. It supports MCP to extend its capabilities with external tools and services.

    ### Enable MCP Support in VS Code
    1. Open VS Code Settings (`Cmd+,` on Mac or `Ctrl+,` on Windows/Linux)
    2. Search for "MCP" in the settings search bar
    3. Enable the `chat.mcp.enabled` setting
    ### Add MCP Server to GitHub Copilot
    You can configure MCP servers for GitHub Copilot in several ways:

        Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your project root:
```json
        {
          "servers": {
            "CopilotKit MCP": {
              "url": "https://mcp.copilotkit.ai/sse"
            }
          }
        }
```
        Add to your VS Code `settings.json`:
```json
        {
          "mcp": {
            "servers": {
              "CopilotKit MCP": {
                "url": "https://mcp.copilotkit.ai/sse"
              }
            }
          }
        }
```
        1. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
        2. Type "MCP: Add Server" and select the command
        3. Choose "HTTP (sse)" as the server type
        4. Enter the server URL: `https://mcp.copilotkit.ai/sse`
        5. Provide a name for the server: `CopilotKit MCP`
    ### Using MCP Tools with GitHub Copilot
    1. Open Copilot Chat in VS Code (click the Copilot icon in the activity bar)
    2. Switch to Agent mode from the chat dropdown menu
    3. Click the Tools (🔧) button to view available MCP tools
    4. Your CopilotKit MCP tools will be listed and can be used automatically

    GitHub Copilot will intelligently use the MCP tools when relevant to your queries. You can also reference tools directly using `#` followed by the tool name.
    ### Managing MCP Servers
    Use the "MCP: List Servers" command to view and manage your configured servers:

    - Start/Stop/Restart servers
    - View server logs for debugging
    - Browse available tools and resources

## Other

For MCP-compatible applications not listed above, use these universal integration patterns. MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that allows AI applications to connect with external tools and data sources.

### Connection Methods

Most MCP-compatible applications support one or both of these connection methods:

    For web-based or remote integrations:
```
    https://mcp.copilotkit.ai/sse
```
    For local command-line integrations:
```json
    {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.copilotkit.ai"]
    }
```

### Integration Steps

1. **Find MCP Settings** - Look for "MCP," "Model Context Protocol," or "Tools" in your application settings
2. **Add Server** - Use the SSE URL: `https://mcp.copilotkit.ai/sse`
3. **Test Connection** - Restart your application and verify the server appears in available tools

### Common Configuration Patterns

    Many applications use a configuration file (locations vary by app):
```json
    {
      "servers": {
        "CopilotKit MCP": {
          "url": "https://mcp.copilotkit.ai/sse"
        }
      }
    }
```
    Some apps integrate MCP into their main settings:
```json
    {
      "mcp": {
        "enabled": true,
        "servers": {
          "CopilotKit MCP": {
            "url": "https://mcp.copilotkit.ai/sse"
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

### Copilot Runtime
- Route: `/agent-spec/copilot-runtime`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/copilot-runtime.mdx`
- Description: The Copilot Runtime is the backend that connects your frontend to your AI agents, providing authentication, middleware, routing, and more.

The Copilot Runtime is the backend layer that connects your frontend application to your AI agents. It's set up during the [quickstart](/quickstart) and is the recommended way to use CopilotKit.

## Setting Up the Runtime

The runtime is a lightweight server endpoint that you add to your backend. Here's a minimal example using Next.js:

```ts title="app/api/copilotkit/route.ts"
import {
  CopilotRuntime,
  ExperimentalEmptyAdapter,
  copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint,
} from "@copilotkit/runtime";
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";

const serviceAdapter = new ExperimentalEmptyAdapter();

const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  agents: {
    // your agents go here
  },
});

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
    runtime,
    serviceAdapter,
    endpoint: "/api/copilotkit",
  });

  return handleRequest(req);
};
```

Then point your frontend at the endpoint:

```tsx
<CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit">
  <YourApp />
</CopilotKit>
```

For setup with other backend frameworks (Express, NestJS, Node.js HTTP), see the [quickstart](/quickstart).

## The Default Agent

If you register an agent with the name `"default"`, CopilotKit's prebuilt UI components will use it automatically without any additional configuration on the frontend. This is useful when you have one primary agent and don't want to specify an `agentId` everywhere.

```ts title="app/api/copilotkit/route.ts"
const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  agents: {
    // This agent will be used automatically by CopilotPopup, CopilotSidebar, etc.
    "default": new HttpAgent({ url: "https://my-agent.example.com" }),
  },
});
```

When you register multiple agents, the `"default"` agent is what powers the chat unless a specific agent is selected. Other agents can still be used by passing their `agentId` to `useAgent` or the prebuilt components.

## What the Runtime Provides

### Authentication and Security

The runtime runs on your server, which means agent communication stays server-side. This gives you a trusted environment to enforce authentication, validate requests, and keep API keys secure. When you use the runtime, safe defaults are put in place so your agent endpoints are not exposed to unauthenticated access.

### AG-UI Middleware

The [AG-UI protocol](/ag-ui-protocol) supports a middleware layer (`agent.use`) for logging, guardrails, request transformation, and more. Because the runtime runs server-side, this middleware executes in a trusted environment where it cannot be tampered with by the client.

### Agent Routing

When you register multiple agents with the runtime, it handles discovery and routing automatically. Your frontend doesn't need to know the details of where each agent lives or how to reach it.

### Premium Features

Features like [threads](/premium/threads), [observability](/premium/observability), and the [inspector](/premium/inspector) are provided through the runtime. These give you conversation persistence, monitoring, and debugging capabilities out of the box.

## What If I Want to Connect to My AG-UI Agent Directly?

CopilotKit is built on the [AG-UI protocol](/ag-ui-protocol), which is an open standard. If you want to connect your frontend directly to an AG-UI-compatible agent without the runtime, you can do so by passing agent instances directly to the `CopilotKit` provider:

```tsx
import { HttpAgent } from "@ag-ui/client";

const myAgent = new HttpAgent({
  url: "https://my-agent.example.com",
});

<CopilotKit agents__unsafe_dev_only={{ "my-agent": myAgent }}>
  <YourApp />
</CopilotKit>
```

Direct agent connections are intended for development and prototyping. This approach is not recommended for production unless you are confident in your setup, and is not officially supported by CopilotKit. If you run into issues with a direct connection, you will need to troubleshoot on your own.

There are important things to understand before going this route:

1. **Authentication is your responsibility.** When you use the Copilot Runtime, safe defaults are put in place so that your agent endpoints are not exposed to unauthenticated access. When you connect directly, it is entirely up to you to secure your agent endpoint and manage authentication.

2. **Many ecosystem features won't work.** The AG-UI protocol supports a middleware layer designed to run on the backend. Many features in the CopilotKit ecosystem depend on this server-side middleware. Without the runtime, these features — including [threads](/premium/threads), [observability](/premium/observability), and other capabilities — will not be available.

### Comparison

| | With Runtime | Direct Connection |
|---|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Safe defaults provided | You manage it |
| **AG-UI Middleware** | Runs server-side | Not available |
| **Agent Routing** | Automatic | Manual |
| **Ecosystem Features** | Full support | Limited |
| **CopilotKit Support** | Supported | Not supported |
| **Setup** | Requires a backend endpoint | Frontend-only |

        {message.content}
        {/* [!code highlight:2] */}
        {/* This will render the tool-based HITL if it exists */}
        {message.role === "assistant" && message.generativeUI?.()}
      </p>
    ))}
  )
};
```

### Slots
- Route: `/agent-spec/custom-look-and-feel/slots`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/custom-look-and-feel/slots.mdx`
- Description: Customize any part of the chat UI by overriding individual sub-components via slots for Agent Spec.

## What is this?

Every CopilotKit chat component is built from composable **slots** — named sub-components that you can override individually. The slot system gives you three levels of customization without needing to rebuild the entire UI:

1. **Tailwind classes** — pass a string to add/override CSS classes
2. **Props override** — pass an object to override specific props on the default component
3. **Custom component** — pass your own React component to fully replace a slot

Slots are recursive — you can drill into nested sub-components at any depth.

## Tailwind Classes

The simplest way to customize a slot. Pass a Tailwind class string and it will be merged with the default component's classes.

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

export function Chat() {
  return (
    <CopilotChat
      // [!code highlight:2]
      messageView="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900 p-4"
      input="border-2 border-blue-400 rounded-xl"
    />
  );
}
```

## Props Override

Pass an object to override specific props on the default component. This is useful for adding `className`, event handlers, data attributes, or any other prop the default component accepts.

```tsx title="page.tsx"
<CopilotChat
  // [!code highlight:4]
  messageView={{
    className: "my-custom-messages",
    "data-testid": "message-view",
  }}
  input={{ autoFocus: true }}
/>
```

## Custom Components

For full control, pass your own React component. It receives all the same props as the default component.

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

// [!code highlight:8]
const CustomMessageView = ({ messages, isRunning }) => (
  <div className="space-y-4 p-6">
    {messages?.map((msg) => (
      <div key={msg.id} className={msg.role === "user" ? "text-right" : "text-left"}>
        {msg.content}
      </div>
    ))}
    {isRunning && <div className="animate-pulse">Thinking...</div>}
  </div>
);

export function Chat() {
  return (
    // [!code highlight:1]
    <CopilotChat messageView={CustomMessageView} />
  );
}
```

## Nested Slots (Drill-Down)

Slots are recursive. You can customize sub-components at any depth by nesting objects.

### Two levels deep

Override the assistant message's toolbar within the message view:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
<CopilotChat
  // [!code highlight:7]
  messageView={{
    assistantMessage: {
      toolbar: CustomToolbar,
      copyButton: CustomCopyButton,
    },
    userMessage: CustomUserMessage,
  }}
/>
```

### Three levels deep

Override a specific button inside the assistant message toolbar:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
<CopilotChat
  messageView={{
    // [!code highlight:5]
    assistantMessage: {
      copyButton: ({ onClick }) => (
        <button onClick={onClick}>Copy</button>
      ),
    },
  }}
/>
```

### Input sub-slots

```tsx title="page.tsx"
<CopilotChat
  input={{
    // [!code highlight:2]
    textArea: CustomTextArea,
    sendButton: CustomSendButton,
  }}
/>
```

### Scroll view sub-slots

```tsx title="page.tsx"
<CopilotChat
  scrollView={{
    // [!code highlight:2]
    feather: CustomFeather,
    scrollToBottomButton: CustomScrollButton,
  }}
/>
```

### Suggestion view sub-slots

```tsx title="page.tsx"
<CopilotChat
  suggestionView={{
    // [!code highlight:2]
    suggestion: CustomSuggestionPill,
    container: CustomSuggestionContainer,
  }}
/>
```

## Children Render Function

For complete layout control, use the `children` render function pattern. This gives you pre-built slot elements that you can arrange however you want.

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

export function Chat() {
  return (
    <CopilotChat>
      {/* [!code highlight:8] */}
      {({ messageView, input, scrollView, suggestionView }) => (
        <div className="flex flex-col h-full">
          <header className="p-4 border-b font-semibold">My Agent</header>
          {scrollView}
          <div className="border-t p-4">{input}</div>
        </div>
      )}
    </CopilotChat>
  );
}
```

## Labels

Customize any text string in the UI via the `labels` prop. This does not use the slot system — it's a separate convenience prop on `CopilotChat`, `CopilotSidebar`, and `CopilotPopup`.

```tsx title="page.tsx"
<CopilotChat
  // [!code highlight:5]
  labels={{
    chatInputPlaceholder: "Ask your agent anything...",
    welcomeMessageText: "How can I help you today?",
    chatDisclaimerText: "AI responses may be inaccurate.",
  }}
/>
```

### Display-only
- Route: `/agent-spec/generative-ui/your-components/display-only`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/generative-ui/your-components/display-only.mdx`
- Description: Register React components that your agent can render in the chat for Agent Spec.

## What is this?

`useComponent` lets you register a React component as a tool your agent can invoke. When the agent calls the tool, CopilotKit renders your component directly in the chat with the tool's arguments as props.

This is the simplest form of Generative UI — your agent decides when to show a component, and CopilotKit renders it. No handler logic, no user interaction required.

## When should I use this?

Use `useComponent` when you want to:
- Display rich UI (cards, charts, tables) inline in the chat
- Show structured data from agent responses
- Render previews, status indicators, or visual feedback
- Let the agent present information beyond plain text

For components that need user interaction, see the Interactive or Interrupt-based guides.

## Register a component

Use the `useComponent` hook to register a React component. The agent will be able to call it by name, and CopilotKit will render it with the tool arguments as props.

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { useComponent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2"; // [!code highlight]
import { z } from "zod";

const weatherSchema = z.object({
  city: z.string().describe("City name"),
  temperature: z.number().describe("Temperature in Fahrenheit"),
  condition: z.string().describe("Weather condition"),
});

function WeatherCard({ city, temperature, condition }: z.infer<typeof weatherSchema>) {
  return (
    <div className="rounded-lg border p-4">
      <h3 className="font-semibold">{city}</h3>
      <p className="text-2xl">{temperature}°F</p>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">{condition}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function YourMainContent() {
  // [!code highlight:9]
  useComponent({
    name: "showWeather",
    description: "Display a weather card for a city.",
    parameters: weatherSchema,
    render: WeatherCard,
  });

  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>;
}
```

## Without parameters

For simple components that don't need typed parameters:

```tsx
useComponent({
  name: "showGreeting",
  render: ({ message }: { message: string }) => (
    <div className="rounded border p-3 bg-blue-50">
      <p>{message}</p>
    </div>
  ),
});
```

## Scoping to an agent

In multi-agent setups, scope a component to a specific agent:

```tsx
useComponent({
  name: "renderProfile",
  parameters: z.object({ userId: z.string() }),
  render: ProfileCard,
  agentId: "support-agent",
});
```

### Interactive

- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/generative-ui/your-components/interactive.mdx`
- Description: Create components that your agent can use to interact with the user for Agent Spec.

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { useHumanInTheLoop } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2" // [!code highlight]

export function Page() {
  // ...

  // [!code highlight:20]
  useHumanInTheLoop({
    name: "humanApprovedCommand",
    description: "Ask human for approval to run a command.",
    parameters: z.object({
      command: z.string().describe("The command to run"),
    }),
    render: ({ args, respond, status }) => {
      if (status !== "executing") return <></>;
      return (
        <div>
          <pre>{args.command}</pre>
          {/* [!code highlight:2] */}
          <button onClick={() => respond?.(`Command is APPROVED`)}>Approve</button>
          <button onClick={() => respond?.(`Command is DENIED`)}>Deny</button>
        </div>
      );
    },
  });

  // ...
}
```

              );
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
```
```
        Can you show me two good options for a restaurant name?
```

### Overview
- Route: `/agent-spec`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/index.mdx`
- Description: Bring your Agent‑Spec agents to your users with CopilotKit via AG‑UI.

# Open Agent Spec x CopilotKit

Open Agent Spec (Agent Spec), originally developed by Oracle, is a portable language for defining agentic systems. It defines building blocks for standalone agents and structured agentic workflows as well as common ways of composing them into multi-agent systems.
Agent Spec enables users to author agents once and run them with any compatible runtime. Agent Spec decouples design from execution, helping deliver more predictable behavior across frameworks.

Now, with the CopilotKit integration, you can bring your Agent Spec agents to an interactive UI using CopilotKit and AG‑UI. Use our Next.js starter to connect a CopilotKit UI to your Agent Spec FastAPI endpoint that streams AG‑UI events.

This integration is centered on two components:
- Backend: AG‑UI exporter for Agent Spec (`pyagentspec` Python package) at [the AG-UI GitHub repo](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/integrations/agent-spec/python). It loads an Agent Spec config (yaml/json) and runs it on your chosen framework via supported Agent Spec adapters (currently LangGraph or WayFlow), translating Agent Spec tracing events into AG‑UI events and sending them to the CopilotKit-powered frontend via a FastAPI endpoint.
- Frontend: CopilotKit UI (Next.js) that consumes AG‑UI events and renders chat, tool calls/results, and generative UI.

Quickly scaffold the UI, then wire your backend endpoint that streams AG‑UI events.

## Quickstart

```bash
npx copilotkit@latest create -f agent-spec
```

Then set your backend endpoint (default `http://localhost:8000/copilotkit`):

```dotenv title=".env.local"
COPILOTKIT_REMOTE_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/copilotkit
```

Run your Agent Spec FastAPI server and start the Next.js app.
For backend installation and endpoint wiring, follow the [Quickstart](/agent-spec/quickstart) and the per‑adapter guides: [LangGraph integration](/agent-spec/langgraph) and [WayFlow integration](/agent-spec/wayflow).

## How it works

- Backend: Your FastAPI endpoint (from the AG-UI Agent Spec integration) emits AG‑UI SSE events.
- Frontend: The Next.js template proxies requests to your backend using CopilotKit Runtime.
- Protocol: AG‑UI spans/events power streaming text, tool calls and results, and run lifecycle.

### Inspector
- Route: `/agent-spec/inspector`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/inspector.mdx`
- Description: Inspector for debugging actions, readables, agent status, messages, and context.

## What it shows

The CopilotKit Inspector is a built-in debugging tool that overlays on your app, giving you full visibility into what's happening between your frontend and your agents in real time.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **AG-UI Events** | View the raw AG-UI event stream between your frontend and agent in real time. |
| **Available Agents** | See which agents are connected and available to your app. |
| **Agent State** | Inspect your agent's current state as it updates. |
| **Frontend Tools** | See what tools you've defined on the frontend and their parameter schemas. |
| **Context** | View the context you've provided to the agent, including readables and document context. |

## Disabling the Inspector

The Inspector is enabled by default. To disable it, set `enableInspector` to `false`:

```tsx
<CopilotKit
  publicLicenseKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COPILOTKIT_LICENSE_KEY}
  enableInspector={false}
>
  {children}
</CopilotKit>
```

No matter what, **the inspector automatically disables when you create a production build.**

### Agent Spec LangGraph Integration with AG-UI
- Route: `/agent-spec/langgraph`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/langgraph.mdx`
- Description: Install pyagentspec with the LangGraph adapter and expose a FastAPI endpoint that streams AG‑UI events for CopilotKit.

## What is this?

Wire an Agent Spec agent backed by LangGraph to CopilotKit’s UI via the AG‑UI event protocol. You’ll run a FastAPI endpoint that emits AG‑UI events and point your Next.js app at it.

Key pieces:
- Backend endpoint: `ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python/ag_ui_agentspec/endpoint.py`
- Example server: `ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python/examples/server.py`
- Template UI: `npx copilotkit@latest create -f agent-spec`

## When should I use this?

Use this integration when you already have a LangGraph-based agent described by an Agent Spec and want a turnkey UI that streams assistant text, tool calls/results, and run lifecycle with minimal wiring.

- Python 3.10–3.14
- Node.js 20+
- An Agent Spec config JSON/YAML file (or Python code via `pyagentspec`)

## Install the Agent Spec AG-UI integration

From the AG‑UI repo’s Agent Spec integration package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui.git
cd ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python
uv pip install -e .[langgraph]
```

Note that this installs `pyagentspec` from source. Alternatively, you may install it with pip:

```bash
pip install pyagentspec[langgraph]
```

## Steps

### 1. Start a FastAPI endpoint (minimal example)

Use the LangGraph runtime to execute your Agent Spec and stream AG‑UI events.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from ag_ui_agentspec.agent import AgentSpecAgent
from ag_ui_agentspec.endpoint import add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint

agentspec_json = <loaded json/yaml string of your Agent Spec config> 

app = FastAPI()
agent = AgentSpecAgent(agentspec_json, runtime="langgraph")
add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint(app, agentspec_agent=agent, path="/")
```

Run locally:

```bash
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Scaffold and connect the UI

You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding.

If you don't already have CopilotKit and your agent connected, choose one of the following options:

    You can follow the instructions in the [quickstart](/agent-spec/quickstart) guide.
    Run the following command to create a brand new project with a pre-configured agent:

```bash
    npx copilotkit@latest create -f agent-spec
```

If you already have the starter, make sure your agent runs on port 8000.

Then run the app (for example with `pnpm dev`) and open `http://localhost:3000`.

## How it works

- `AgentSpecAgent(runtime="langgraph")` executes your Agent Spec agent with the LangGraph framework.
- In the `AgentSpecAgent` wrapper, `AgUiSpanProcessor` maps Agent Spec tracing spans to AG‑UI events on a per‑request queue (`EVENT_QUEUE`).
- The FastAPI endpoint streams those events as SSE for CopilotKit to render:
  - assistant text: `TEXT_MESSAGE_START/CONTENT/END`
  - tool calls: `TOOL_CALL_START/ARGS/END` and `TOOL_CALL_RESULT`
  - lifecycle: `RUN_STARTED/RUN_FINISHED`

## Troubleshooting

- The endpoint path must match your UI’s expected agent endpoint (port 8000 in our starter repo).
- The endpoint asserts a queue is bound. If you get queue errors, check that requests go through the provided FastAPI route.
- If you are not receiving any events, make sure the agent is running and did not crash.

## Next steps

- Build richer UIs with agentic chat and generative UI.
- Pass full chat history between turns. The adapter and processor handle messages and tool‑call lifecycle for you.
- Check out the [WayFlow runtime](/agent-spec/wayflow)

### Observability
- Route: `/agent-spec/premium/observability`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/premium/observability.mdx`
- Description: Monitor your CopilotKit application with comprehensive observability hooks. Understand user interactions, chat events, and system errors.

Monitor CopilotKit with first‑class observability hooks that emit structured signals for chat events, user interactions, and runtime errors. Send these signals straight to your existing stack, including Sentry, Datadog, New Relic, and OpenTelemetry, or route them to your analytics pipeline. The hooks expose stable schemas and IDs so you can join agent events with app telemetry, trace sessions end to end, and alert on failures in real time. Works with Copilot Cloud via `publicApiKey`, or self‑hosted via `publicLicenseKey`.
## Quick Start

  All observability hooks require a `publicLicenseKey` or `publicAPIkey` - Get yours free at
  [https://cloud.copilotkit.ai](https://cloud.copilotkit.ai)

### Chat Observability Hooks

Track user interactions and chat events with comprehensive observability hooks:

```tsx
import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit
      publicApiKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicApiKey for Copilot Cloud
      // OR
      publicLicenseKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicLicenseKey for self-hosted
    >
      <CopilotChat
        observabilityHooks={{
          // [!code highlight]
          onMessageSent: (message) => {
            // [!code highlight]
            console.log("Message sent:", message);
            analytics.track("chat_message_sent", { message });
          }, // [!code highlight]
          onChatExpanded: () => {
            // [!code highlight]
            console.log("Chat opened");
            analytics.track("chat_expanded");
          }, // [!code highlight]
          onChatMinimized: () => {
            // [!code highlight]
            console.log("Chat closed");
            analytics.track("chat_minimized");
          }, // [!code highlight]
          onFeedbackGiven: (messageId, type) => {
            // [!code highlight]
            console.log("Feedback:", type, messageId);
            analytics.track("chat_feedback", { messageId, type });
          }, // [!code highlight]
        }} // [!code highlight]
      />
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}
```

### Error Observability

Monitor system errors and performance with error observability hooks:

```tsx
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit
      publicApiKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicApiKey for Copilot Cloud
      // OR
      publicLicenseKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicLicenseKey for self-hosted
      onError={(errorEvent) => {
        // [!code highlight]
        // Send errors to monitoring service
        console.error("CopilotKit Error:", errorEvent);

        // Example: Send to analytics
        analytics.track("copilotkit_error", {
          type: errorEvent.type,
          source: errorEvent.context.source,
          timestamp: errorEvent.timestamp,
        });
      }} // [!code highlight]
      showDevConsole={false} // Hide dev console in production
    >
      {/* Your app */}
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}
```

## Observability Features

### CopilotChat Observability Hooks

Track user interactions, chat behavior and errors with comprehensive observability hooks (requires a `publicLicenseKey` if self-hosted or `publicAPIkey` if using CopilotCloud):

```tsx
import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

<CopilotChat
  observabilityHooks={{
    onMessageSent: (message) => {
      console.log("Message sent:", message);
      // Track message analytics
      analytics.track("chat_message_sent", { message });
    },
    onChatExpanded: () => {
      console.log("Chat opened");
      // Track engagement
      analytics.track("chat_expanded");
    },
    onChatMinimized: () => {
      console.log("Chat closed");
      // Track user behavior
      analytics.track("chat_minimized");
    },
    onMessageRegenerated: (messageId) => {
      console.log("Message regenerated:", messageId);
      // Track regeneration requests
      analytics.track("chat_message_regenerated", { messageId });
    },
    onMessageCopied: (content) => {
      console.log("Message copied:", content);
      // Track content sharing
      analytics.track("chat_message_copied", { contentLength: content.length });
    },
    onFeedbackGiven: (messageId, type) => {
      console.log("Feedback given:", messageId, type);
      // Track user feedback
      analytics.track("chat_feedback_given", { messageId, type });
    },
    onChatStarted: () => {
      console.log("Chat generation started");
      // Track when AI starts responding
      analytics.track("chat_generation_started");
    },
    onChatStopped: () => {
      console.log("Chat generation stopped");
      // Track when AI stops responding
      analytics.track("chat_generation_stopped");
    },
    onError: (errorEvent) => {
      console.log("Error occurred", errorEvent);
      // Log error
      analytics.track("error_event", errorEvent);
    },
  }}
/>;
```

**Available Observability Hooks:**

- `onMessageSent(message)` - User sends a message
- `onChatExpanded()` - Chat is opened/expanded
- `onChatMinimized()` - Chat is closed/minimized
- `onMessageRegenerated(messageId)` - Message is regenerated
- `onMessageCopied(content)` - Message is copied
- `onFeedbackGiven(messageId, type)` - Thumbs up/down feedback given
- `onChatStarted()` - Chat generation starts
- `onChatStopped()` - Chat generation stops
- `onError(errorEvent)` - Error events and system monitoring

**Requirements:**

- ✅ Requires a `publicLicenseKey` (when self-hosting) or `publicApiKey` from [Copilot Cloud](https://cloud.copilotkit.ai)
- ✅ Works with `CopilotChat`, `CopilotPopup`, `CopilotSidebar`, and all pre-built components

  **Important:** Observability hooks will **not trigger** without a valid
  key. This is a security feature to ensure observability hooks only
  work in authorized applications.

## Error Event Structure

The `onError` handler receives detailed error events with rich context:

```typescript
interface CopilotErrorEvent {
  type:
    | "error"
    | "request"
    | "response"
    | "agent_state"
    | "action"
    | "message"
    | "performance";
  timestamp: number;
  context: {
    source: "ui" | "runtime" | "agent";
    request?: {
      operation: string;
      method?: string;
      url?: string;
      startTime: number;
    };
    response?: {
      endTime: number;
      latency: number;
    };
    agent?: {
      name: string;
      nodeName?: string;
    };
    messages?: {
      input: any[];
      messageCount: number;
    };
    technical?: {
      environment: string;
      stackTrace?: string;
    };
  };
  error?: any; // Present for error events
}
```

## Common Observability Patterns

### Chat Event Tracking

```tsx
<CopilotChat
  observabilityHooks={{
    onMessageSent: (message) => {
      // Track message analytics
      analytics.track("chat_message_sent", {
        messageLength: message.length,
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        userId: getCurrentUserId(),
      });
    },
    onChatExpanded: () => {
      // Track user engagement
      analytics.track("chat_expanded", {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        userId: getCurrentUserId(),
      });
    },
    onFeedbackGiven: (messageId, type) => {
      // Track feedback for AI improvement
      analytics.track("chat_feedback", {
        messageId,
        feedbackType: type,
        timestamp: Date.now(),
      });
    },
  }}
/>
```

### Combined Event and Error Tracking

```tsx
<CopilotKit
  publicApiKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicApiKey for Copilot Cloud
  // OR
  publicLicenseKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicLicenseKey for self-hosted
  onError={(errorEvent) => {
    // Error observability
    if (errorEvent.type === "error") {
      console.error("CopilotKit Error:", errorEvent);
      analytics.track("copilotkit_error", {
        error: errorEvent.error?.message,
        context: errorEvent.context,
      });
    }
  }}
>
  <CopilotChat
    observabilityHooks={{
      onMessageSent: (message) => {
        // Event tracking
        analytics.track("chat_message_sent", { message });
      },
      onChatExpanded: () => {
        analytics.track("chat_expanded");
      },
    }}
  />
</CopilotKit>
```

## Error Observability Patterns

### Basic Error Logging

```tsx
<CopilotKit
  publicApiKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicApiKey for Copilot Cloud
  // OR
  publicLicenseKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicLicenseKey for self-hosted
  onError={(errorEvent) => {
    console.error("[CopilotKit Error]", {
      type: errorEvent.type,
      timestamp: new Date(errorEvent.timestamp).toISOString(),
      context: errorEvent.context,
      error: errorEvent.error,
    });
  }}
>
  {/* Your app */}
</CopilotKit>
```

### Integration with Monitoring Services

```tsx
// Example with Sentry
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

<CopilotKit
  publicApiKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicApiKey for Copilot Cloud
  // OR
  publicLicenseKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicLicenseKey for self-hosted
  onError={(errorEvent) => {
    if (errorEvent.type === "error") {
      Sentry.captureException(errorEvent.error, {
        tags: {
          source: errorEvent.context.source,
          operation: errorEvent.context.request?.operation,
        },
        extra: {
          context: errorEvent.context,
          timestamp: errorEvent.timestamp,
        },
      });
    }
  }}
>
  {/* Your app */}
</CopilotKit>;
```

### Custom Error Analytics

```tsx
<CopilotKit
  publicApiKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicApiKey for Copilot Cloud
  // OR
  publicLicenseKey="ck_pub_your_key" // [!code highlight] - Use publicLicenseKey for self-hosted
  onError={(errorEvent) => {
    // Track different error types
    analytics.track("copilotkit_event", {
      event_type: errorEvent.type,
      source: errorEvent.context.source,
      agent_name: errorEvent.context.agent?.name,
      latency: errorEvent.context.response?.latency,
      error_message: errorEvent.error?.message,
      timestamp: errorEvent.timestamp,
    });
  }}
>
  {/* Your app */}
</CopilotKit>
```

## Development vs Production Setup

### Development Environment

```tsx
<CopilotKit
  runtimeUrl="http://localhost:3000/api/copilotkit"
  publicLicenseKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COPILOTKIT_LICENSE_KEY} // Self-hosted
  // OR
  publicApiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COPILOTKIT_API_KEY} // Using Copilot Cloud
  showDevConsole={true} // Show visual errors
  onError={(errorEvent) => {
    // Simple console logging for development
    console.log("CopilotKit Event:", errorEvent);
  }}
>
  <CopilotChat
    observabilityHooks={{
      onMessageSent: (message) => {
        console.log("Message sent:", message);
      },
      onChatExpanded: () => {
        console.log("Chat expanded");
      },
    }}
  />
</CopilotKit>
```

### Production Environment

```tsx
<CopilotKit
  runtimeUrl="https://your-app.com/api/copilotkit"
  publicLicenseKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COPILOTKIT_LICENSE_KEY} // [!code highlight]
  // OR
  publicApiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COPILOTKIT_API_KEY} // [!code highlight]
  showDevConsole={false} // Hide from users
  onError={(errorEvent) => {
    // Production error observability
    if (errorEvent.type === "error") {
      // Log critical errors
      logger.error("CopilotKit Error", {
        error: errorEvent.error,
        context: errorEvent.context,
        timestamp: errorEvent.timestamp,
      });

      // Send to monitoring service
      monitoring.captureError(errorEvent.error, {
        extra: errorEvent.context,
      });
    }
  }}
>
  <CopilotChat
    observabilityHooks={{
      onMessageSent: (message) => {
        // Track production analytics
        analytics.track("chat_message_sent", {
          messageLength: message.length,
          userId: getCurrentUserId(),
        });
      },
      onChatExpanded: () => {
        analytics.track("chat_expanded");
      },
      onFeedbackGiven: (messageId, type) => {
        // Track feedback for AI improvement
        analytics.track("chat_feedback", { messageId, type });
      },
    }}
  />
</CopilotKit>
```

### CopilotKit Premium
- Route: `/agent-spec/premium/overview`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/premium/overview.mdx`
- Description: Premium features for CopilotKit.

## What is CopilotKit Premium?
CopilotKit Premium plans deliver:
- A commercial license for premium extensions to the open source CopilotKit framework (self-hosted or using Copilot Cloud)
- Access to the Copilot Cloud hosted service.

CopilotKit Premium is designed for teams building production-grade, agent-powered applications with CopilotKit.
Premium extension features — such as Fully Headless UI and debugging tools — can be used in both self-hosted and cloud-hosted deployments.

The Developer tier of CopilotKit Premium is always free.

## Premium Plans
- Developer – Free forever, includes early-stage access and limited cloud usage
- Pro – For growing teams building in production
- Enterprise – For organizations with advanced scalability, security, and support needs
## Early Access
Certain features—like the Headless UI—will initially be available only to Premium subscribers before becoming part of the open-source core as the framework matures.
All CopilotKit Premium subscribers get early access to new features, tooling, and integrations as they are released.

## Current Premium Features
- [Fully Headless Chat UI](headless-ui) - Early Access
- [Observability Hooks](observability)
- [Copilot Cloud](https://cloud.copilotkit.ai)

## FAQs

### How do I get access to premium features?

#### Option 1:  Use Copilot Cloud!
All CopilotKit Premium features are included in Copilot Cloud.

#### Option 2:  Self-host with a license key.
Access to premium features requires a public license key. To get yours, follow the steps below.

    #### Sign up

    Create a *free* account on [Copilot Cloud](https://cloud.copilotkit.ai).

    This does not require a credit card or use of Copilot Cloud.
    #### Get your public license key

    Once you've signed up, you'll be able to get your public license key from the left nav.
    #### Use the public license key

    Once you've signed up, you'll be able to use the public license key in your CopilotKit instance.

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
    <CopilotKit publicLicenseKey="your-public-license-key" />
```

### Can I still self-host with a public license key?

Yes, you can still self-host with a public license key. It is only required if you want to use premium features,
for access to Copilot Cloud a public API key is utilized.

### What is the difference between a public license key and a public API key?

A public API key is a key that you use to connect your app to Copilot Cloud. Public license keys are used to access premium features
and do not require a connection to Copilot Cloud.

### Programmatic Control
- Route: `/agent-spec/programmatic-control`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/programmatic-control.mdx`
- Description: Control your Agent Spec agent programmatically with useAgent and copilotkit.runAgent().

### Import the hook

    First, import `useAgent` from the v2 package:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
    import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2"; // [!code highlight]
```

    ### Access your agent

    Call the hook to get a reference to your agent:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
    export function AgentInfo() {
      const { agent } = useAgent(); // [!code highlight]

      return (
        <div>
          {/* [!code highlight:4] */}
          <p>Agent ID: {agent.id}</p>
          <p>Thread ID: {agent.threadId}</p>
          <p>Status: {agent.isRunning ? "Running" : "Idle"}</p>
          <p>Messages: {agent.messages.length}</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
```

    The hook will throw an error if no agent is configured, so you can safely use `agent` without null checks.

    ### Display messages

    Access the agent's conversation history:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
    export function MessageList() {
      const { agent } = useAgent();

      return (
        <div>
          {/* [!code highlight:6] */}
          {agent.messages.map((msg) => (
            <div key={msg.id}>
              <strong>{msg.role}:</strong>
              <span>{msg.content}</span>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      );
    }
```

    ### Show running status

    Add a loading indicator when the agent is processing:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
    export function AgentStatus() {
      const { agent } = useAgent();

      return (
        <div>
          {/* [!code highlight:8] */}
          {agent.isRunning ? (
            <div>
              <div className="spinner" />
              <span>Agent is processing...</span>
            </div>
          ) : (
            <span>Ready</span>
          )}
        </div>
      );
    }
```

    ### Run the agent

    Use `copilotkit.runAgent()` to trigger your agent programmatically:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
    import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    import { useCopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    import { randomUUID } from "@copilotkit/shared/v2";

    export function RunAgent() {
      const { agent } = useAgent();
      // [!code highlight:1]
      const { copilotkit } = useCopilotKit();

      const handleRun = async () => {
        agent.addMessage({
          id: randomUUID(),
          role: "user",
          content: "Hello, agent!",
        });

        // [!code highlight:1]
        await copilotkit.runAgent({ agent });
      };

      return <button onClick={handleRun}>Send</button>;
    }
```

    `copilotkit.runAgent()` orchestrates the full agent lifecycle — executing frontend tools, handling follow-up runs, and streaming results. This is the same method `` uses internally.

## Working with State

Agents expose their state through the `agent.state` property. This state is shared between your application and the agent - both can read and modify it.

### Reading State

Access your agent's current state:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
export function StateDisplay() {
  const { agent } = useAgent();

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Agent State</h3>
      {/* [!code highlight:1] */}
      <pre>{JSON.stringify(agent.state, null, 2)}</pre>

      {/* Access specific properties */}
      {/* [!code highlight:2] */}
      {agent.state.user_name && <p>User: {agent.state.user_name}</p>}
      {agent.state.preferences && <p>Preferences: {JSON.stringify(agent.state.preferences)}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Your component automatically re-renders when the agent's state changes.

### Updating State

Update state that your agent can access:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
export function ThemeSelector() {
  const { agent } = useAgent();

  const updateTheme = (theme: string) => {
    // [!code highlight:4]
    agent.setState({
      ...agent.state,
      user_theme: theme,
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* [!code highlight:2] */}
      <button onClick={() => updateTheme("dark")}>Dark Mode</button>
      <button onClick={() => updateTheme("light")}>Light Mode</button>
      <p>Current: {agent.state.user_theme || "default"}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

State updates are immediately available to your agent in its next execution.

## Subscribing to Agent Events

You can subscribe to agent events using the `subscribe()` method. This is useful for logging, monitoring, or responding to specific agent behaviors.

### Basic Event Subscription

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import type { AgentSubscriber } from "@ag-ui/client";

export function EventLogger() {
  const { agent } = useAgent();

  useEffect(() => {
    // [!code highlight:15]
    const subscriber: AgentSubscriber = {
      onCustomEvent: ({ event }) => {
        console.log("Custom event:", event.name, event.value);
      },
      onRunStartedEvent: () => {
        console.log("Agent started running");
      },
      onRunFinalized: () => {
        console.log("Agent finished running");
      },
      onStateChanged: (state) => {
        console.log("State changed:", state);
      },
    };

    // [!code highlight:2]
    const { unsubscribe } = agent.subscribe(subscriber);
    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, []);

  return null;
}
```

### Available Events

The `AgentSubscriber` interface provides:

- **`onCustomEvent`** - Custom events emitted by the agent
- **`onRunStartedEvent`** - Agent starts executing
- **`onRunFinalized`** - Agent completes execution
- **`onStateChanged`** - Agent's state changes
- **`onMessagesChanged`** - Messages are added or modified

## Rendering Tool Calls

You can customize how agent tool calls are displayed in your UI. First, define your tool renderers:

```tsx title="components/weather-tool.tsx"
import { defineToolCallRenderer } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

// [!code highlight:6]
export const weatherToolRender = defineToolCallRenderer({
  name: "get_weather",
  render: ({ args, status }) => {
    return <WeatherCard location={args.location} status={status} />;
  },
});

function WeatherCard({ location, status }: { location?: string; status: string }) {
  return (
    <div className="rounded-lg border p-6 shadow-sm">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Weather in {location}</h3>
      <div className="mt-4">
        <span className="text-5xl font-light">70°F</span>
      </div>
      {status === "executing" && <div className="spinner">Loading...</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Register your tool renderers with CopilotKit:

```tsx title="layout.tsx"
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import { weatherToolRender } from "./components/weather-tool";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <CopilotKit
      runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
      {/* [!code highlight:1] */}
      renderToolCalls={[weatherToolRender]}
    >
      {children}
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}
```

Then use `useRenderToolCall` to render tool calls from agent messages:

```tsx title="components/message-list.tsx"
import { useAgent, useRenderToolCall } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

export function MessageList() {
  const { agent } = useAgent();
  const renderToolCall = useRenderToolCall();

  return (
    <div className="messages">
      {agent.messages.map((message) => (
        <div key={message.id}>
          {/* Display message content */}
          {message.content && <p>{message.content}</p>}

          {/* Render tool calls if present */}
          {/* [!code highlight:9] */}
          {message.role === "assistant" && message.toolCalls?.map((toolCall) => {
            const toolMessage = agent.messages.find(
              (m) => m.role === "tool" && m.toolCallId === toolCall.id
            );
            return (
              <div key={toolCall.id}>
                {renderToolCall({ toolCall, toolMessage })}
              </div>
            );
          })}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Building a Complete Dashboard

Here's a full example combining all concepts into an interactive agent dashboard:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
"use client";

import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

export default function AgentDashboard() {
  const { agent } = useAgent();

  return (
    <div className="p-8 max-w-4xl mx-auto space-y-6">
      {/* Status */}
      <div className="p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Agent Status</h2>
        <div className="space-y-2">
          {/* [!code highlight:6] */}
          <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
            <div className={`w-3 h-3 rounded-full ${
              agent.isRunning ? "bg-yellow-500 animate-pulse" : "bg-green-500"
            }`} />
            <span>{agent.isRunning ? "Running" : "Idle"}</span>
          </div>
          <div>Thread: {agent.threadId}</div>
          <div>Messages: {agent.messages.length}</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* State */}
      <div className="p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Agent State</h2>
        {/* [!code highlight:3] */}
        <pre className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded text-sm overflow-auto">
          {JSON.stringify(agent.state, null, 2)}
        </pre>
      </div>

      {/* Messages */}
      <div className="p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Conversation</h2>
        <div className="space-y-3">
          {/* [!code highlight:11] */}
          {agent.messages.map((msg) => (
            <div
              key={msg.id}
              className={`p-3 rounded-lg ${
                msg.role === "user" ? "bg-blue-50 ml-8" : "bg-gray-50 mr-8"
              }`}
            >
              <div className="font-semibold text-sm mb-1">
                {msg.role === "user" ? "You" : "Agent"}
              </div>
              <div>{msg.content}</div>
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Running the Agent Programmatically

Use `copilotkit.runAgent()` to trigger your agent from any component — no chat UI required. This is the same method CopilotKit's built-in `` uses internally.

```tsx title="page.tsx"
import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { useCopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { randomUUID } from "@copilotkit/shared/v2";

export function AgentTrigger() {
  const { agent } = useAgent();
  // [!code highlight:1]
  const { copilotkit } = useCopilotKit();

  const handleRun = async () => {
    // Add a user message to the agent's conversation
    agent.addMessage({
      id: randomUUID(),
      role: "user",
      content: "Summarize the latest sales data",
    });

    // [!code highlight:2]
    // Run the agent — handles tool execution, follow-ups, and streaming
    await copilotkit.runAgent({ agent });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleRun}>Run Agent</button>;
}
```

### `copilotkit.runAgent()` vs `agent.runAgent()`

Both methods trigger the agent, but they operate at different levels:

- **`copilotkit.runAgent({ agent })`** — The recommended approach. Orchestrates the full agent lifecycle: executes frontend tools, handles follow-up runs when tools request them, and manages errors through the subscriber system.
- **`agent.runAgent()`** — Low-level method on the agent instance. Sends the request to the runtime but does **not** execute frontend tools or handle follow-ups. Use this only when you need direct control over the agent execution (e.g., resuming from an interrupt with `forwardedProps`).

### Stopping a Run

You can stop a running agent using `copilotkit.stopAgent()`:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
const handleStop = () => {
  copilotkit.stopAgent({ agent });
};
```

### Quickstart
- Route: `/agent-spec/quickstart`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/quickstart.mdx`
- Description: Set up Agent Spec + AG‑UI and connect a CopilotKit UI. Includes per‑adapter install steps and a minimal endpoint.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.10–3.13

## 1) Install the Agent Spec AG‑UI adapter (backend)

The AG‑UI integration for Agent Spec lives in `ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python`. Here's how to install it:

```bash
# Clone the adapter and move into the Python package
git clone https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui.git
cd ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python
```

As this integration package uses `uv` as the package manager, you can easily install it with:

```bash
uv sync
```

Agent Spec is a specification language that declares the structure of your agents and workflows. Agent Spec agents can be run on various agent frameworks. Currently, we support LangGraph and WayFlow (Oracle's reference agent framework, with native support for Agent Spec).
Here are the different installation options depending on which agent framework you want to execute your Agent Spec agent on:

```bash
uv sync --extra langgraph                         # for LangGraph
uv sync --extra wayflow                           # for WayFlow
uv sync --extra langgraph --extra wayflow         # for both
```

Alternatively, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install -e .[wayflow]
pip install -e .[langgraph]
pip install -e .[wayflow,langgraph]
```

Note: these commands would install [`pyagentspec`](https://github.com/oracle/agent-spec) and [`wayflowcore`](https://github.com/oracle/wayflow) packages from source (i.e. the respective GitHub repos).
Instead, you can install these packages from PyPI separately:

```bash
pip install pyagentspec[langgraph]
pip install wayflowcore
```

Environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.2
```

Note that these environment variables can point to any OpenAI-compatible LLM provider (e.g., local vLLM server, Together AI), but the variable names need to be `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_MODEL`.

## 2) Scaffold the UI

Start from our starter template:

```bash
npx copilotkit@latest create -f agent-spec
```

Or use the full starter repo template: https://github.com/CopilotKit/with-agent-spec. It includes an example definition of an Agent Spec agent [here](https://github.com/CopilotKit/with-agent-spec/blob/main/agent/src/agentspec_agent.py).

Note that the `npx` command automatically installs the AG-UI Agent Spec integration at https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/integrations/agent-spec/python, which install `pyagentspec` and optional runtime adapter dependencies as explained above.

### Minimal starter Agent Spec agent definition

```python agentspec_agent.py
from pyagentspec.agent import Agent
from pyagentspec.llms import OpenAiCompatibleConfig
from pyagentspec.serialization import AgentSpecSerializer

agentspec_agent = Agent(
    name="AgentSpecAgent",
    description="A starter Agent that can call tools.",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant, named Specky, that speaks a lot.",
    llm_config=OpenAiCompatibleConfig(
        name="my-llm",
        model_id="gpt-5.2",
        url="https://api.openai.com/v1",
    ),
)

agent_spec_config = AgentSpecSerializer().to_json(agentspec_agent)
```

## 3) Add a minimal FastAPI endpoint (backend)

Create a FastAPI app that loads your Agent Spec file and exposes an AG‑UI FastAPI endpoint. Replace the `runtime` to match your adapter (`langgraph` or `wayflow`).

```python src/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from ag_ui_agentspec.agent import AgentSpecAgent
from ag_ui_agentspec.endpoint import add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint

agent_spec_config = <loaded json/yaml string of your Agent Spec agent>
runtime = "langgraph"  # or "wayflow"

app = FastAPI()
agent = AgentSpecAgent(agent_spec_config=agent_spec_config, runtime=runtime)
add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint(app, agentspec_agent=agent, path="/")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True)
```

Here, we use the `add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint` utility from the integration pacakge. It sets up the endpoint and the wiring of Agent Spec Tracing events to AG-UI events.

To run the backend agent:

```bash
uv run src/main.py
```

## 4) Connect the UI to your frontend server

Make sure the frontend UI server knows what host/port the backend agent is running on. In this tutorial, we use http://localhost:8000/ as the host/port.

## 5) Run Next.js

From the root directory of [our starter repo](https://github.com/sonleoracle/with-agent-spec/), run:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or npm run dev / yarn dev / bun dev
```

Note that this command also launches the agent backend in `agent/src`. Now, open http://localhost:3000 and start chatting with your agent.

## Tools and tool registry

If your Agent Spec includes server-side tools that execute in the same environment as the agent, map them by name to Python callables in a dictionary `tool_registry` when loading `AgentSpecAgent`.

```python title="Bind backend tools by name"
from __future__ import annotations
from fastapi import FastAPI
from ag_ui_agentspec.agent import AgentSpecAgent
from ag_ui_agentspec.endpoint import add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint

def get_weather(city: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {"city": city, "temp_c": 22}

tool_registry = {"get_weather": get_weather}

app = FastAPI()
agent = AgentSpecAgent(
    agent_spec_config=<json/yaml string of your Agent Spec Agent>,
    runtime="langgraph",  # or "wayflow"
    tool_registry=tool_registry,
)
add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint(app, agentspec_agent=agent, path="/")
```

Frontend tools (corresponding to Agent Spec `ClientTool`) run in the browser and don't need to be added to the tool registry — see [Generative UI Frontend Tools](/agent-spec/frontend-tools) for details.

## What is happening under the hood

Agent Spec, and the `pyagentspec` SDK, helps you define agents and workflows in a readable and portable config object/JSON file.
The different adapters, LangGraph and WayFlow, loads your Agent Spec configs into framework-specific objects and executes them. In other words, Agent Spec is the "compiler", and the frameworks are the "runtimes".
During this conversion process, the adapter configures the loaded object so that it would emit Agent Spec Tracing events. These are standardized across runtimes.
Finally, the AG-UI Agent Spec integration listens to Agent Spec Tracing events and exports them to AG-UI events. These include agent execution, tool calls, messages being sent by the agent, etc.
In other words, if the agent emits an event during execution (this is runtime-dependent), a corresponding AG-UI event will be created.
In the frontend, CopilotKit converts and renders AG-UI events into the UI.

## I am getting network errors / API not found error

If you're encountering network or API errors, here's how to troubleshoot:

        Verify your endpoint configuration in your CopilotKit setup:

```tsx
        <CopilotKit
          runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
        >
          {/* Your app */}
        </CopilotKit>
```

        or, if using CopilotCloud
```tsx
        <CopilotKit
            publicApiKey="<your-copilot-cloud-public-api-key>"
        >
            {/* Your app */}
        </CopilotKit>
```

        Common issues:
        - Missing leading slash in endpoint path
        - Incorrect path relative to your app's base URL, or, if using absolute paths, incorrect full URL
        - Typos in the endpoint path
        - If using CopilotCloud, make sure to omit the `runtimeUrl` property and provide a valid API key
        If you're running locally and getting connection errors, try using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`:

```bash
        # If this doesn't work:
        http://localhost:3000/api/copilotkit

        # Try this instead:
        http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/copilotkit
```

        This is often due to local DNS resolution issues in `/etc/hosts` or network configuration.
        Make sure your backend server is:
        - Running on the expected port
        - Accessible from your frontend
        - Not blocked by CORS or firewalls

        Check the [quickstart](/quickstart) to see how to set it up

## I am getting "CopilotKit's Remote Endpoint" not found error

If you're getting a "CopilotKit's Remote Endpoint not found" error, it usually means the server serving `/info` endpoint isn't accessible. Here's how to fix it:

        Refer to [Remote Python Endpoint](/guides/backend-actions/remote-backend-endpoint) to see how to set it up
        The `/info` endpoint should return agent or action information. Test it directly:

```bash
        curl -v -d '{}' http://localhost:8000/copilotkit/info
```
        The response looks something like this:
```bash
        * Host localhost:8000 was resolved.
        * IPv6: ::1
        * IPv4: 127.0.0.1
        *   Trying [::1]:8000...
        * connect to ::1 port 8000 from ::1 port 55049 failed: Connection refused
        *   Trying 127.0.0.1:8000...
        * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8000
        > POST /copilotkit/info HTTP/1.1
        > Host: localhost:8000
        > User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
        > Accept: */*
        > Content-Length: 2
        > Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        >
        * upload completely sent off: 2 bytes
        < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        < date: Thu, 16 Jan 2025 17:45:05 GMT
        < server: uvicorn
        < content-length: 214
        < content-type: application/json
        <
        * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
        {"actions":[],"agents":[{"name":"my_agent","description":"A helpful agent.","type":"langgraph"},],"sdkVersion":"0.1.32"}%
```

        As you can see, it's a JSON response with your registered agents and actions, as well as the `200 OK` HTTP response status.
        If you see a different response, check your FastAPI logs for errors.

## Connection issues with tunnel creation

If you notice the tunnel creation process spinning indefinitely, your router or ISP might be blocking the connection to CopilotKit's tunnel service.

        To verify connectivity to the tunnel service, try these commands:

```bash
        ping tunnels.devcopilotkit.com
        curl -I https://tunnels.devcopilotkit.com
        telnet tunnels.devcopilotkit.com 443
```

        If these fail, your router's security features or ISP might be blocking the connection. Common solutions:
        - Check router security settings
        - Contact your ISP to verify if they're blocking the connection
        - Try a different network to confirm the issue

### Error Debugging & Observability
- Route: `/agent-spec/troubleshooting/error-debugging`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/troubleshooting/error-debugging.mdx`
- Description: Learn how to debug errors in CopilotKit with dev console and set up error observability for monitoring services.

# How to Debug Errors

CopilotKit provides visual error display for local development and debugging. This feature is completely free and requires no API keys.

## Quick Setup

```tsx
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit
      runtimeUrl="<your-runtime-url>"
      showDevConsole={true} // [!code highlight]
    >
      {/* Your app */}
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}
```

  Avoid showing the dev console in production as it exposes internal error details to end users.

## When to Use Development Debugging

- **Local development** - See errors immediately in your UI
- **Quick debugging** - No setup required, works out of the box
- **Testing** - Verify error handling during development

## Troubleshooting

### Development Debugging Issues

- **Dev console not showing:**
  - Confirm `showDevConsole={true}`
  - Check for JavaScript errors in the browser console
  - Ensure no CSS is hiding the error banner

### Migrate to 1.10.X
- Route: `/agent-spec/troubleshooting/migrate-to-1.10.X`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/troubleshooting/migrate-to-1.10.X.mdx`
- Description: Migration guide for CopilotKit 1.10.X

## Overview

CopilotKit 1.10.X introduces a new headless UI system and simplified message formats. Most existing code will continue to work, but you may need to update custom message handling.

**What you need to know:**
- Message format has changed from classes to plain objects
- New headless UI hook available for advanced use cases
- Backwards compatibility maintained for most features

## Key Improvements & Changes

### Enhanced Message Format

Messages now use plain objects instead of classes for better performance and simpler handling.

#### Before
```tsx
const message = new TextMessage({
  role: MessageRole.Assistant,
  content: "Hello, how are you?",
})
```

#### After
```tsx
const message = { 
  role: "assistant", 
  content: "Hello, how are you?" 
}
```

### Simplified Message Type Checking

Message type checking has been streamlined for better developer experience. Instead of using the previous
`isTextMessage` or adjacent methods, you can now check the `role` property of the message.

#### Before
```tsx
if (message.isTextMessage()) {
  if (message.role === "assistant") {
    console.log(message.content)
  }
  if (message.role === "user") {
    console.log(message.content)
  }
}

if (message.isImageMessage()) {
  console.log(message.image)
}

if (message.isActionExecutionMessage()) {
  console.log(message.toolCalls)
}

// etc...
```

#### After
```tsx
if (message.role === "assistant") {
  console.log(
    message.content,
    message.toolCalls,
    message.image,
  )
}

if (message.role === "user") {
  console.log(
    message.content,
    message.image,
  )
}
```

### Custom Assistant Messages
Previously, you had to use the `subComponent` property to render custom assistant messages. Now you can use the `generativeUI` property instead.

**Important!** Both will continue to work.

#### Before

```tsx
import { AssistantMessageProps } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

export const AssistantMessage = (props: AssistantMessageProps) => {
  const { message, subComponent } = props;

  return (
    <div style={{ marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>{subComponent}</div>
  );
};
```

#### After

```tsx
import { AssistantMessageProps } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

export const AssistantMessage = (props: AssistantMessageProps) => {
  const { message } = props;

  return (
    <div style={{ marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}>{message.generativeUI}</div>
  );
};
```

#### Backwards Compatibility

- Custom sub-components remain fully supported
- Both `subComponent` (legacy) and `generativeUI` (new) properties work
- Existing `useCopilotChat` code continues to function

## New Features

### Advanced Headless UI Hook

New `useCopilotChatHeadless_c` hook provides complete control over chat UI:

**Features:**
- Complete control over chat UI rendering
- Built-in generative UI support
- Advanced suggestions management
- Interrupt handling for human-in-the-loop workflows

An example of how you might use the new Headless UI hook:

```tsx
const { messages, suggestions, interrupt } = useCopilotChatHeadless_c();

return (
  <div>
    {suggestions.map((suggestion) => (
      <div key={suggestion.id}>{suggestion.title}</div>
    ))}

    {interrupt}

    {messages.map((message) => {
      switch (message.role) {
        case "assistant":
          if (message.generativeUI) return message.generativeUI
          return <div key={message.id}>{message.content}</div>
        case "user":
          return <div key={message.id}>{message.content}</div>
      }
    })}
  </div>
)
```

[Read more about the new headless UI hook and get started](/premium/headless-ui).

## What about `useCopilotChat`?

With the introduction of the new headless UI hook, we are starting the deprecation of `useCopilotChat`. While it will remain supported for several months in maintenance mode, all new headless UI features will be added to `useCopilotChatHeadless_c`.

We recommend migrating to the new hook for new projects. However, please feel free to continue using `useCopilotChat` until you are ready to migrate.

### When to Migrate

**Continue using `useCopilotChat` if:**
- Your current implementation works well
- You don't need advanced headless features
- You prefer gradual migration

**Migrate to `useCopilotChatHeadless_c` if:**
- Starting a new project
- Building new headless UI implementations
- Need generative UI capabilities
- Want access to advanced suggestions and interrupts
- Building fully custom chat experiences

### Migrate to 1.8.2
- Route: `/agent-spec/troubleshooting/migrate-to-1.8.2`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/troubleshooting/migrate-to-1.8.2.mdx`
- Description: Migration guide for CopilotKit 1.8.2

## What's changed?

### New Look and Feel

CopilotKit 1.8.2 introduces a new default look and feel. This includes new use of theming variables, new components, and generally a fresh look.

**Click the button in the bottom right to see the new look and feel in action!**

### Thumbs Up/Down Handlers

The chat components now have `onThumbsUp` and `onThumbsDown` handlers. Specifying these will add icons to each message
on hover allowing the user to provide feedback.

```tsx
<CopilotChat 
  onThumbsUp={(message) => console.log(message)} 
  onThumbsDown={(message) => console.log(message)}     
/>
```

This was previously achievable in our framework, but we're making it first class now! You can use this to help fine-tune your model through CopilotKit
or just generally track user feedback.

### ResponseButton prop removed

The `ResponseButton` prop has been removed. This was a prop that was used to customize the button that appears after a response was generated
in the chat.

In its place, we now place buttons below each message for:
- Thumbs up
- Thumbs down
- Copy
- Regenerate

The behvior, icons and styling for each of these buttons can be customized. Checkout our [look and feel guides](/custom-look-and-feel) for more details.

### Out-of-the-box dark mode support

CopilotKit now has out-of-the-box dark mode support. This is controlled by the `.dark` class (Tailwind) as well as the
`color-scheme` CSS selector.

If you would like to make a custom theme, you can do so by checking out the [custom look and feel](/custom-look-and-feel) guides.

### Migrate to V2
- Route: `/agent-spec/troubleshooting/migrate-to-v2`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/troubleshooting/migrate-to-v2.mdx`
- Description: Migration guide for upgrading to CopilotKit V2 frontend packages

## Overview

CopilotKit V2 consolidates the frontend into a single package. Both hooks and UI components are now exported from `@copilotkit/react-core/v2`. Your backend does not need any changes.

**What's changing:**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `@copilotkit/react-core` | `@copilotkit/react-core/v2` |
| `@copilotkit/react-ui` | `@copilotkit/react-core/v2` |
| `@copilotkit/react-ui/styles.css` | `@copilotkit/react-core/v2/styles.css` |

**What's NOT changing:**
- Backend packages (`@copilotkit/runtime`, etc.) — no changes needed
- Your `CopilotRuntime` configuration — stays the same
- Agent definitions and backend setup — stays the same

## Migration Steps

### Update `@copilotkit/react-core` imports

Replace imports from `@copilotkit/react-core` with `@copilotkit/react-core/v2`.

#### Before
```tsx
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import { useCopilotReadable, useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
```

#### After
```tsx
import { CopilotKitProvider } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
```

### Replace `@copilotkit/react-ui` imports

UI components like `CopilotChat`, `CopilotSidebar`, and `CopilotPopup` are now exported from `@copilotkit/react-core/v2`.

#### Before
```tsx
import { CopilotPopup } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
import { CopilotSidebar } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
```

#### After
```tsx
import { CopilotPopup } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { CopilotSidebar } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
```

### Update your styles import

#### Before
```tsx
import "@copilotkit/react-ui/styles.css";
```

#### After
```tsx
import "@copilotkit/react-core/v2/styles.css";
```

### Upgrade `@ag-ui/client` (if using directly)

If you import from `@ag-ui/client` directly, upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
npm install @ag-ui/client@latest
```

Note: If you only use CopilotKit's React packages, `@ag-ui/client` types are already re-exported from `@copilotkit/react-core/v2` and you don't need a separate install.

## Full Example

### Before

```tsx
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import { CopilotPopup } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
import "@copilotkit/react-ui/styles.css";

export function App() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit">
      <YourApp />
      <CopilotPopup />
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}
```

### After

```tsx
import { CopilotKitProvider, CopilotPopup } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import "@copilotkit/react-core/v2/styles.css";

export function App() {
  return (
    <CopilotKitProvider runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit">
      <YourApp />
      <CopilotPopup />
    </CopilotKitProvider>
  );
}
```

### Agent Spec WayFlow Integration with AG-UI
- Route: `/agent-spec/wayflow`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/integrations/agent-spec/wayflow.mdx`
- Description: Connect an Agent Spec (WayFlow runtime) to CopilotKit via the AG‑UI endpoint and stream agent runs to the UI.

## What is this?

Wire an Agent Spec agent backed by WayFlow to CopilotKit’s UI via the AG‑UI event protocol. You’ll run a FastAPI endpoint that emits AG‑UI events and point your Next.js app at it.

Key pieces:
- Backend endpoint: `ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python/ag_ui_agentspec/endpoint.py`
- Example server: `ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python/examples/server.py`
- Template UI: `npx copilotkit@latest create -f agent-spec`

## When should I use this?

Use this integration when you already have a WayFlow-based agent described by an Agent Spec and want a turnkey UI that streams assistant text, tool calls/results, and run lifecycle with minimal wiring.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10–3.14
- Node.js 20+
- An Agent Spec config JSON/YAML file (or Python code via `pyagentspec`)

## Install runtime adapter

From the AG‑UI repo’s Agent Spec adapter package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui.git
cd ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python
uv pip install -e .[wayflow]
```

Note that this installs `wayflowcore` from source. Alternatively, you may install it with pip:

```bash
pip install wayflowcore
```

## Steps

### 1. Start a FastAPI endpoint (minimal example)

Use the WayFlow runtime to execute your Agent Spec and stream AG‑UI events.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from ag_ui_agentspec.agent import AgentSpecAgent
from ag_ui_agentspec.endpoint import add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint

agentspec_json = <loaded json/yaml of your Agent Spec config>

app = FastAPI()
agent = AgentSpecAgent(agentspec_json, runtime="wayflow")
add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint(app, agentspec_agent=agent, path="/")
```

Run locally:

```bash
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Scaffold and connect the UI

You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding.

If you don't already have CopilotKit and your agent connected, choose one of the following options:

    You can follow the instructions in the [quickstart](/agent-spec/quickstart) guide.
    Run the following command to create a brand new project with a pre-configured agent:

```bash
    npx copilotkit@latest create -f agent-spec
```

If you already have the starter, make sure your agent runs on port 8000.

Then run the app (for example with `pnpm dev`) and open `http://localhost:3000`.

## How it works

- `AgentSpecAgent(runtime="wayflow")` executes your Agent Spec agent with the WayFlow framework.
- `AgUiSpanProcessor` maps Agent Spec tracing spans to AG‑UI events on a per‑request queue (`EVENT_QUEUE`).
- The FastAPI endpoint streams those events as SSE for CopilotKit to render:
  - assistant text: `TEXT_MESSAGE_START/CONTENT/END`
  - tool calls: `TOOL_CALL_START/ARGS/END` and `TOOL_CALL_RESULT`
  - lifecycle: `RUN_STARTED/RUN_FINISHED`

## Troubleshooting

- The endpoint path must match your UI’s expected agent endpoint (port 8000 in our starter repo).
- The endpoint asserts a queue is bound. If you get queue errors, check that requests go through the provided FastAPI route.
- If you are not receiving any events, make sure the agent is running and did not crash.
