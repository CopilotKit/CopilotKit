# Backend

Runtime architecture, endpoint setup, AG-UI protocol, and backend integration.

## Guidance
### Copilot Runtime
- Route: `/backend/copilot-runtime`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/(root)/backend/copilot-runtime.mdx`
- Description: The Copilot Runtime is the backend that connects your frontend to your AI agents, providing authentication, middleware, routing, and more.

The Copilot Runtime is the backend layer that connects your frontend application to your AI agents. It's set up during the [quickstart](/quickstart) and is the recommended way to use CopilotKit.

## Setting Up the Runtime

The runtime is a lightweight server endpoint that you add to your backend. Here's a minimal example using Next.js:

```ts title="app/api/copilotkit/route.ts"
import {
  CopilotRuntime,
  ExperimentalEmptyAdapter,
  copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint,
} from "@copilotkit/runtime";
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";

const serviceAdapter = new ExperimentalEmptyAdapter();

const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  agents: {
    // your agents go here
  },
});

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
    runtime,
    serviceAdapter,
    endpoint: "/api/copilotkit",
  });

  return handleRequest(req);
};
```

Then point your frontend at the endpoint:

```tsx
<CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit">
  <YourApp />
</CopilotKit>
```

For setup with other backend frameworks (Express, NestJS, Node.js HTTP), see the [quickstart](/quickstart).

## The Default Agent

If you register an agent with the name `"default"`, CopilotKit's prebuilt UI components will use it automatically without any additional configuration on the frontend. This is useful when you have one primary agent and don't want to specify an `agentId` everywhere.

```ts title="app/api/copilotkit/route.ts"
const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  agents: {
    // This agent will be used automatically by CopilotPopup, CopilotSidebar, etc.
    "default": new HttpAgent({ url: "https://my-agent.example.com" }),
  },
});
```

When you register multiple agents, the `"default"` agent is what powers the chat unless a specific agent is selected. Other agents can still be used by passing their `agentId` to `useAgent` or the prebuilt components.

## What the Runtime Provides

### Authentication and Security

The runtime runs on your server, which means agent communication stays server-side. This gives you a trusted environment to enforce authentication, validate requests, and keep API keys secure. When you use the runtime, safe defaults are put in place so your agent endpoints are not exposed to unauthenticated access.

### AG-UI Middleware

The [AG-UI protocol](/ag-ui-protocol) supports a middleware layer (`agent.use`) for logging, guardrails, request transformation, and more. Because the runtime runs server-side, this middleware executes in a trusted environment where it cannot be tampered with by the client.

### Agent Routing

When you register multiple agents with the runtime, it handles discovery and routing automatically. Your frontend doesn't need to know the details of where each agent lives or how to reach it.

### Premium Features

Features like [threads](/premium/threads), [observability](/premium/observability), and the [inspector](/premium/inspector) are provided through the runtime. These give you conversation persistence, monitoring, and debugging capabilities out of the box.

## What If I Want to Connect to My AG-UI Agent Directly?

CopilotKit is built on the [AG-UI protocol](/ag-ui-protocol), which is an open standard. If you want to connect your frontend directly to an AG-UI-compatible agent without the runtime, you can do so by passing agent instances directly to the `CopilotKit` provider:

```tsx
import { HttpAgent } from "@ag-ui/client";

const myAgent = new HttpAgent({
  url: "https://my-agent.example.com",
});

<CopilotKit agents__unsafe_dev_only={{ "my-agent": myAgent }}>
  <YourApp />
</CopilotKit>
```

Direct agent connections are intended for development and prototyping. This approach is not recommended for production unless you are confident in your setup, and is not officially supported by CopilotKit. If you run into issues with a direct connection, you will need to troubleshoot on your own.

There are important things to understand before going this route:

1. **Authentication is your responsibility.** When you use the Copilot Runtime, safe defaults are put in place so that your agent endpoints are not exposed to unauthenticated access. When you connect directly, it is entirely up to you to secure your agent endpoint and manage authentication.

2. **Many ecosystem features won't work.** The AG-UI protocol supports a middleware layer designed to run on the backend. Many features in the CopilotKit ecosystem depend on this server-side middleware. Without the runtime, these features — including [threads](/premium/threads), [observability](/premium/observability), and other capabilities — will not be available.

### Comparison

| | With Runtime | Direct Connection |
|---|---|---|
| **Authentication** | Safe defaults provided | You manage it |
| **AG-UI Middleware** | Runs server-side | Not available |
| **Agent Routing** | Automatic | Manual |
| **Ecosystem Features** | Full support | Limited |
| **CopilotKit Support** | Supported | Not supported |
| **Setup** | Requires a backend endpoint | Frontend-only |

### AG-UI
- Route: `/backend/ag-ui`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/(root)/backend/ag-ui.mdx`
- Description: How CopilotKit uses the AG-UI protocol to connect your frontend to your AI agents.

CopilotKit is built on the [AG-UI protocol](https://ag-ui.com) — a lightweight, event-based standard that defines how AI agents communicate with user-facing applications over Server-Sent Events (SSE).

Everything in CopilotKit — messages, state updates, tool calls, and more — flows through AG-UI events. Understanding this layer helps you debug, extend, and build on top of CopilotKit more effectively.

## Accessing Your Agent with `useAgent`

The `useAgent` hook is your primary interface to the AG-UI agent powering your copilot. It returns an [`AbstractAgent`](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/blob/main/typescript/packages/client/src/agents/abstract-agent.ts) from the AG-UI client library — the same base type that all AG-UI agents implement.

```tsx
import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

function MyComponent() {
  const { agent } = useAgent();

  // agent.messages - conversation history
  // agent.state - current agent state
  // agent.isRunning - whether the agent is currently running
}
```

If you have multiple agents, pass the `agentId` to select one:

```tsx
const { agent } = useAgent({ agentId: "research-agent" });
```

The returned `agent` is a standard AG-UI `AbstractAgent`. You can subscribe to its events, read its state, and interact with it using the same interface defined by the [AG-UI specification](https://docs.ag-ui.com).

### Subscribing to AG-UI Events

Every agent exposes a `subscribe` method that lets you listen for specific AG-UI events as they stream in. Each callback receives the event and the current agent state:

```tsx
import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import { useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  const { agent } = useAgent();

  useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = agent.subscribe({
      // Called on every event
      onEvent({ event, agent }) {
        console.log("Event:", event.type, event);
      },

      // Text message streaming
      onTextMessageContentEvent({ event, textMessageBuffer, agent }) {
        console.log("Streaming text:", textMessageBuffer);
      },

      // Tool calls
      onToolCallEndEvent({ event, toolCallName, toolCallArgs, agent }) {
        console.log("Tool called:", toolCallName, toolCallArgs);
      },

      // State updates
      onStateSnapshotEvent({ event, agent }) {
        console.log("State snapshot:", agent.state);
      },

      // High-level lifecycle
      onMessagesChanged({ agent }) {
        console.log("Messages updated:", agent.messages);
      },
      onStateChanged({ agent }) {
        console.log("State changed:", agent.state);
      },
    });

    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
  }, [agent]);
}
```

The full list of subscribable events maps directly to the [AG-UI event types](https://docs.ag-ui.com/concepts/events):

| Event | Callback | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run lifecycle | `onRunStartedEvent`, `onRunFinishedEvent`, `onRunErrorEvent` | Agent run start, completion, and errors |
| Steps | `onStepStartedEvent`, `onStepFinishedEvent` | Individual step boundaries within a run |
| Text messages | `onTextMessageStartEvent`, `onTextMessageContentEvent`, `onTextMessageEndEvent` | Streaming text content from the agent |
| Tool calls | `onToolCallStartEvent`, `onToolCallArgsEvent`, `onToolCallEndEvent`, `onToolCallResultEvent` | Tool invocation lifecycle |
| State | `onStateSnapshotEvent`, `onStateDeltaEvent` | Full state snapshots and incremental deltas |
| Messages | `onMessagesSnapshotEvent` | Full message list snapshots |
| Custom | `onCustomEvent`, `onRawEvent` | Custom and raw events for extensibility |
| High-level | `onMessagesChanged`, `onStateChanged` | Aggregate notifications after any message or state mutation |

## The Proxy Pattern

When you use CopilotKit with a runtime, your frontend never talks directly to your agent. Instead, CopilotKit creates a **proxy agent** on the frontend that forwards requests through the Copilot Runtime.

On startup, CopilotKit calls the runtime's `/info` endpoint to discover which agents are available. Each agent is wrapped in a `ProxiedCopilotRuntimeAgent` — a thin client that extends AG-UI's [`HttpAgent`](https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/blob/main/typescript/packages/client/src/agents/http-agent.ts). From your component's perspective, this proxy behaves identically to a local AG-UI agent: same `AbstractAgent` interface, same subscribe API, same properties. But under the hood, every `run` call is an HTTP request to your server, and every response is an SSE stream of AG-UI events flowing back.

```tsx title="What your component sees"
const { agent } = useAgent(); // Returns an AbstractAgent
agent.messages;               // Read messages
agent.state;                  // Read state
agent.subscribe({ ... });     // Subscribe to events
```

```tsx title="What actually happens"
// useAgent() → AgentRegistry checks /info → wraps each agent in ProxiedCopilotRuntimeAgent
// agent.runAgent() → HTTP POST to runtime → runtime routes to your agent → SSE stream back
```

This indirection is what enables the runtime to provide authentication, middleware, agent routing, and ecosystem features like [threads](/premium/threads) and [observability](/premium/observability) — without changing how you interact with agents on the frontend.

## How Agents Slot into the Runtime

On the server side, the `CopilotRuntime` accepts a map of AG-UI `AbstractAgent` instances. Each agent framework provides its own implementation, but they all extend the same base type:

```ts title="app/api/copilotkit/route.ts"
import { CopilotRuntime, copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint } from "@copilotkit/runtime";
import { HttpAgent } from "@ag-ui/client";

const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  agents: {
    "my-agent": new HttpAgent({
      url: "https://my-agent-server.example.com",
    }),
  },
});

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
    runtime,
    endpoint: "/api/copilotkit",
  });
  return handleRequest(req);
};
```

When a request comes in:

1. The runtime resolves the target agent by ID
2. It clones the agent (for thread safety) and sets messages, state, and thread context from the request
3. The `AgentRunner` executes the agent, which produces a stream of AG-UI `BaseEvent`s
4. Events are encoded as SSE and streamed back to the frontend proxy

Because every agent is an `AbstractAgent`, you can register any AG-UI-compatible agent — whether it's an `HttpAgent` pointing at a remote server, a framework-specific adapter, or a custom implementation — and the runtime handles routing, middleware, and delivery uniformly.

### MCP (Agents<->Tools)
- Route: `/learn/connect-mcp-servers`
- Source: `docs/content/docs/learn/connect-mcp-servers.mdx`
- Description: Integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers into your React applications

## Introduction

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. With MCP, you can:

- Connect AI applications to your data sources
- Enable AI tools to access and utilize your data securely
- Build AI-powered features that have context about your application

For further reading, check out the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) website.

  If you want MCP servers to return **interactive UI components** that render directly in the chat, check out [MCP Apps](/learn/generative-ui/specs/mcp-apps).

  MCP is one of three prominent [agentic protocols](/agentic-protocols) CopilotKit supports to connect agents to user-facing frontends

## Quickstart with CopilotKit

    ### Get an MCP Server
    First, we need to make sure we have an MCP server to connect to. You can use any MCP SSE endpoint you have configured.

          Composio provides a registry of ready-to-use MCP servers with simple authentication and setup.

          To get started, go to [Composio](https://mcp.composio.dev/), find a server the suits your needs and copy the SSE URL before continuing here.

        ### Run the CLI
        Just run this following command in your Next.js application to get started!

                No problem! Just use `create-next-app` to make one quickly.
```bash
                npx create-next-app@latest
```

```bash
        npx copilotkit@latest init -m MCP
```
        #### Set up the CopilotKit Provider

        Wrap your application with the `CopilotKit` provider:

```tsx
        "use client";

        import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

        export default function App() {
          return (
            <CopilotKit publicApiKey="<replace_with_your_own>">
              {/* Your app content */}
            </CopilotKit>
          );
        }
```
        #### Connect to MCP Servers

        Create a component to manage MCP server connections:

```tsx
        "use client";

        import { useCopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
        import { useEffect } from "react";

        function McpServerManager() {
          const { setMcpServers } = useCopilotKit();

          useEffect(() => {
            setMcpServers([
              {
                // Try a sample MCP server at https://mcp.composio.dev/
                endpoint: "your_mcp_sse_url",
              },
            ]);
          }, [setMcpServers]);

          return null;
        }

        export default McpServerManager;

```
        #### Add the Chat Interface

        Add the `CopilotChat` component to your page:

```tsx
        "use client";

        import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
        import McpServerManager from "./McpServerManager";

        export default function ChatInterface() {
          return (
            <div className="flex h-screen p-4">
              <McpServerManager />
              <CopilotChat
                className="flex-grow rounded-lg w-full"
              />
            </div>
          );
        }
```
        #### Visualize MCP Tool Calls (Optional)

        Create a component to display MCP tool calls in your UI:

```tsx
        "use client";

        import {
          useFrontendTool,
          CatchAllActionRenderProps,
        } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
        import McpToolCall from "./McpToolCall";

        export function ToolRenderer() {
          useFrontendTool({
            /**
             * The asterisk (*) matches all tool calls
             */
            name: "*",
            render: ({ name, status, args, result }: CatchAllActionRenderProps<[]>) => (
              <McpToolCall status={status} name={name} args={args} result={result} />
            ),
          });
          return null;
        }
```
        #### Complete Implementation

        Combine all components together:

```tsx
        "use client";

        import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
        import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
        import McpServerManager from "./McpServerManager";
        import { ToolRenderer } from "./ToolRenderer";

        export default function Page() {
          return (
            <CopilotKit publicApiKey="<replace_with_your_own>">
              <div className="flex h-screen p-4">
                <McpServerManager />
                <CopilotChat
                  className="flex-grow rounded-lg w-full"
                />
                <ToolRenderer />
              </div>
            </CopilotKit>
          );
        }
```

## Advanced Usage

### Implementing the McpToolCall Component

```tsx
"use client";

import * as React from "react";

interface ToolCallProps {
  status: "complete" | "inProgress" | "executing";
  name?: string;
  args?: any;
  result?: any;
}

export default function MCPToolCall({
  status,
  name = "",
  args,
  result,
}: ToolCallProps) {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = React.useState(false);

  // Format content for display
  const format = (content: any): string => {
    if (!content) return "";
    const text =
      typeof content === "object"
        ? JSON.stringify(content, null, 2)
        : String(content);
    return text
      .replace(/\\n/g, "\n")
      .replace(/\\t/g, "\t")
      .replace(/\\"/g, '"')
      .replace(/\\\\/g, "\\");
  };

  return (
    <div className="bg-[#1e2738] rounded-lg overflow-hidden w-full">
      <div
        className="p-3 flex items-center cursor-pointer"
        onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}
      >
        <span className="text-white text-sm overflow-hidden text-ellipsis">
          {name || "MCP Tool Call"}
        </span>
        <div className="ml-auto">
          <div
            className={`w-2 h-2 rounded-full ${
              status === "complete"
                ? "bg-gray-300"
                : status === "inProgress" || status === "executing"
                ? "bg-gray-500 animate-pulse"
                : "bg-gray-700"
            }`}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {isOpen && (
        <div className="px-4 pb-4 text-gray-300 font-mono text-xs">
          {args && (
            <div className="mb-4">
              <div className="text-gray-400 mb-2">Parameters:</div>
              <pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap max-h-[200px] overflow-auto">
                {format(args)}
              </pre>
            </div>
          )}

          {status === "complete" && result && (
            <div>
              <div className="text-gray-400 mb-2">Result:</div>
              <pre className="whitespace-pre-wrap max-h-[200px] overflow-auto">
                {format(result)}
              </pre>
            </div>
          )}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Self-Hosting Option

  The Copilot Runtime handles communication with LLMs, message history, and
  state. You can self-host it or use{" "}
  (recommended). Learn more in our [Self-Hosting Guide](/built-in-agent/copilot-runtime).

To configure your self-hosted runtime with MCP servers, you'll need to implement the `createMCPClient` function that matches this interface:

```typescript
type CreateMCPClientFunction = (
  config: MCPEndpointConfig
) => Promise<MCPClient>;
```

For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the [official MCP SDK documentation](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#writing-mcp-clients).

Here's a basic example of configuring the runtime:

```tsx
import {
  CopilotRuntime,
  OpenAIAdapter,
  copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint,
} from "@copilotkit/runtime";
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";

const serviceAdapter = new OpenAIAdapter();

const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  createMCPClient: async (config) => {
    // Implement your MCP client creation logic here
    // See the MCP SDK docs for implementation details
  },
});

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
    runtime,
    serviceAdapter,
    endpoint: "/api/copilotkit",
  });

  return handleRequest(req);
};
```
