# Step 4: Copilot Actions

Now it's time to make our copilot even more useful by taking actions.

## Available Actions

Once again, let's take a look at our app's state in the [`lib/hooks/use-tasks.tsx`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/example-todos-app/blob/base-start-here/lib/hooks/use-tasks.tsx#L19-L33) file.

Essentially, we want our copilot to be able to call the `addTask`, `setTaskStatus` and `deleteTask` functions.

## The `useCopilotAction` hook

The [`useCopilotAction`](/reference/hooks/useCopilotAction) hook makes actions available to our copilot. Let's implement it in the [`lib/hooks/use-tasks.tsx`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/example-todos-app/blob/base-start-here/lib/hooks/use-tasks.tsx) file.

```tsx filename="lib/hooks/use-tasks.tsx" showLineNumbers {3-3,8-22,24-38,40-61}
// ... the rest of the file

import { useCopilotReadable, useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

export const TasksProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>(defaultTasks);

  useCopilotAction({
    name: "addTask",
    description: "Adds a task to the todo list",
    parameters: [
      {
        name: "title",
        type: "string",
        description: "The title of the task",
        required: true,
      },
    ],
    handler: ({ title }) => {
      addTask(title);
    },
  });

  useCopilotAction({
    name: "deleteTask",
    description: "Deletes a task from the todo list",
    parameters: [
      {
        name: "id",
        type: "number",
        description: "The id of the task",
        required: true,
      },
    ],
    handler: ({ id }) => {
      deleteTask(id);
    },
  });

  useCopilotAction({
    name: "setTaskStatus",
    description: "Sets the status of a task",
    parameters: [
      {
        name: "id",
        type: "number",
        description: "The id of the task",
        required: true,
      },
      {
        name: "status",
        type: "string",
        description: "The status of the task",
        enum: Object.values(TaskStatus),
        required: true,
      },
    ],
    handler: ({ id, status }) => {
      setTaskStatus(id, status);
    },
  });

  // ... the rest of the file
};
```

The `useCopilotAction` hook is a powerful hook that allows us to register actions with our copilot. It takes an object with the following properties:

- `name` is the name of the action.
- `description` is a description of the action. It's important to choose a good description so that our copilot can choose the right action.
- `parameters` is an array of parameters that the action takes. It follows the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format.
- `handler` is a function that will be called when the action is triggered. It's even type safe!

You can check out the full reference for the `useCopilotAction` hook [here](https://docs.copilotkit.com/reference/use-copilot-action).

## Try it out!

Now, head back to the app and ask your pilot to do any of the following:

- "Create a task about inviting Daniel to my birthday"
- "Delete all outstanding tasks"
- "Mark task with ID 2 as done"
- etc.

Your copilot is now more helpful than ever ðŸ’ª
