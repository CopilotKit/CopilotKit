`useCopilotReadable` is a React hook that provides app-state and other information
to the Copilot. Optionally, the hook can also handle hierarchical state within your
application, passing these parent-child relationships to the Copilot.

## Usage

<Steps>

###  `"use client"` (Next.js App Router)
```tsx filename="YourComponent.tsx"
"use client"  // (only necessary if you are using Next.js App Router)
```

Like other React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`, this is a **client-side** hook.
If you're using Next.js with the App Router, you'll need to add the `"use client"` directive at the top of any file using this hook.


  
### Simple Usage
 
```tsx
import { useCopilotChatSuggestions } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
 
export function MyComponent() {
  const [employees, setEmployees] = useState<string[]>([]);
 
  useCopilotChatSuggestions({
    instructions: `Suggest adding more relevant employees to the list based on current employees on duty: ${JSON.stringify(employees)}`,
    minSuggestions: 1,
    maxSuggestions: 2,
  });
}
 
### Dependency Management
 
```tsx
import { useCopilotChatSuggestions } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
 
export function MyComponent() {
  useCopilotChatSuggestions(
    {
      instructions: "Suggest the most relevant next actions.",
      minSuggestions: 1,
      maxSuggestions: 2,
    },
    [relevantState],
  );
}
```
 
In the example above, the suggestions are generated based on the given instructions.
The hook monitors `relevantState`, and updates suggestions accordingly whenever it changes.

</Steps>

---

### Behavior and Lifecycle
 
The hook registers the configuration with the chat context upon component mount and
removes it on unmount, ensuring a clean and efficient lifecycle management.
