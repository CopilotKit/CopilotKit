# Copilot UI & (headless) Copilot OS

## Copilot UI: built-in UI components
CopilotKit provides pre-built UI components for quick integration:

1. [`CopilotChat`](/components/CopilotChat): A flexible, customizable chat interface.

2. [`CopilotSidebar`](/components/CopilotSidebar): Wraps `CopilotChat` in a collapsible sidebar.

3. [`CopilotPopup`](/components/CopilotPopup): Wraps `CopilotChat` in a toggleable popup window.

These components offer instant solutions while allowing easy customization to suit your application's needs.

These components are **[highly customizable](/concepts/customize-look-and-feel)** and can be styled to match your application's look and feel. Alternatively, you can create your own UI using the core functionalities provided by CopilotKit.

## Copilot OS without Copilot UI (Headless UI)
As your product matures, **[`useCopilotChat`](/reference/hooks/useCopilotChat)** provides deeply customizable **headless UI** so you can benefit from Copilot OS while fully controlling the UI layer of your Copilot.

`useCopilotChat` can also be used side-by - side with Copilot UI -- to **programmatically communicate with Copilot OS** and more deeply integrate the Copilot into your application.
