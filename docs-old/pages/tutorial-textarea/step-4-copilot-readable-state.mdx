# Step 4: Copilot Readable State

At this point, we have set up our CopilotKit provider and `<CopilotTextarea />`, and we already benefit from a great AI assistant. However, there is one last problem - the copilot assistant is not aware of the email thread. Let's fix that.

## Our App's State

Let's quickly review how our app's state works. Open up the [`lib/hooks/use-emails.tsx`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/example-textarea/blob/base-start-here/lib/hooks/use-emails.tsx) file.

At a glance, we can see that the file exposes a provider (`EmailsProvider`) which holds our `emails`. This is the context we need to provide to our copilot to get AI autocompletions. 

## The `useCopilotReadable` hook

Our goal is to make our copilot aware of this state, so that it can provide more accurate and helpful responses. We can easily achieve this by using the [`useCopilotReadable`](/reference/hooks/useCopilotReadable) hook.

```tsx filename="libs/hooks/use-emails.tsx" {3,8-11}
// ... the rest of the file

import { useCopilotReadable } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

export const EmailsProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const [emails, setEmails] = useState<Email[]>(emailHistory);

  useCopilotReadable({
    description: "The history of this email thread",
    value: emails
  });

  // ... the rest of the file
}
```

In this example, we use the `useCopilotReadable` hook to provide the copilot with the state of our email thread.

- For the `description` property, we provide a concise description that tells the copilot what this piece of readable data means.
- For the `value` property, we pass the entire state as a JSON string.

In the next step, we'll set up our AI-powered textarea, which will use this readable state to provide accurate and helpful responses.

## Try it out!

Now, go back to the app and start typing things related to the email thread. Some ideas:

- `"Thanks Jo..."` (the assistant will complete John's name)
- `"I'm glad Spac..."` (the assistant will compelte the company's name to SpaceY)
- `"I'm glad they liked my..."` (the assistant will add context)

Your textarea is not fully aware of the email thread, and therefore it provides helpful, relevant autocompletions. ðŸš€
