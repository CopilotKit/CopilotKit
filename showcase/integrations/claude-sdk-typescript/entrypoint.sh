# silent agent hang — the agent process stays alive (so `wait -n` never
# fires and the container never restarts) but stops responding on :8000.
# Poll the agent's /health endpoint every 30s; after 3 consecutive failures
# (~90s of unreachable agent), kill the agent process so `wait -n` returns
# and Railway restarts the container. Generalized from
# showcase/integrations/crewai-crews/entrypoint.sh (PRs #4114 + #4115).

# Startup grace: `node /app/agent_server.js` runs the compiled
# @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk bundle and was observed restart-looping

# shorter than the cold-start path on a fresh container. Wait up to 180s
# for the first successful health probe before arming the strike counter
# so slow cold-starts aren't killed in a loop.
