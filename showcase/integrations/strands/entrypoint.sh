# and tracebacks reach Railway's log stream line-at-a-time rather than

# Poll the agent's /health endpoint every 30s; after 3 consecutive failures
# (90s of unreachable agent), kill the agent process so `wait -n` returns
# and Railway restarts the container. We kill the agent (not the whole

# through the normal path rather than a forced `exit` that would bypass
# logging. Generalized from showcase/integrations/crewai-crews/entrypoint.sh
