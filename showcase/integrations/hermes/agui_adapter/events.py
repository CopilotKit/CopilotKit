"""Translate Hermes ``AIAgent`` callbacks into AG-UI protocol events.

The Hermes agent runs synchronously in a worker thread and communicates
progress through a handful of push callbacks (see ``run_agent.AIAgent``):

    stream_delta_callback(text)          # assistant text deltas; None = flush
    reasoning_callback(text)             # provider reasoning/thinking deltas
    tool_progress_callback(evt, name, preview, args, **kw)  # "tool.started" ...
    step_callback(api_call_count, prev_tools)  # prev_tools carry results

This module owns the *translation* only. It converts those callbacks into
AG-UI ``BaseEvent`` objects and hands them to an ``emit`` callable. Thread
safety and transport (SSE) are the server's concern: ``emit`` is expected to
be safe to call from the agent worker thread (e.g. it pushes onto a queue the
async SSE generator drains).

Mirrors the structure of ``acp_adapter/events.py`` but targets AG-UI event
types instead of ACP ``session_update`` notifications.

Key differences from the ACP bridge:

* Assistant text is a *lifecycle*: AG-UI needs TEXT_MESSAGE_START before the
  first delta and TEXT_MESSAGE_END after the last. The bridge tracks whether a
  text (or reasoning) message is currently open and opens/closes it lazily.
  Reasoning uses the REASONING_MESSAGE_* lifecycle (not THINKING_*), because
  only that builds a ``role:"reasoning"`` message on the client.
* Tool completion + results arrive one step late via ``step_callback`` (the
  ``prev_tools`` of the *next* iteration), exactly as in ACP. A FIFO queue of
  tool-call ids per tool name matches a completion to the right start, so
  parallel/repeated same-name calls stay correctly paired.

Server-tool events stream LIVE and IN ORDER: ``tool.started`` fires while the
tool executes (same iteration the model requested it), so the TOOL_CALL_START/
ARGS land right after any preamble text and BEFORE the model's next-iteration
follow-up narration. That interleaving is the whole point — it keeps live token
streaming (text is never buffered) while putting the tool card ahead of the
narration that comments on its result, matching the north-star DOM order.

The live path is gated to SERVER tools only (:meth:`set_tool_classes`):

* **Frontend/client tools** carry no result on this run — the model call
  unwinds via interrupt and the client executes them. The server's post-run
  handoff owns them (real model-issued ids, ``parent_message_id``), so the
  bridge SKIPS them entirely in the live path.
* **State-writer tools** are INTERNAL: their authoritative UI is the state
  card driven by a ``StateSnapshotEvent``, not a chatty chip. The bridge
  SUPPRESSES their live TOOL_CALL_* events; the server emits the snapshot.

Live server-tool events use GENERATED ids (Hermes' live callbacks do not carry
the model's real tool_call_id). That is fine for server tools: START/ARGS/END/
RESULT self-correlate via the per-name FIFO and there is no client round-trip
that would need id matching.
