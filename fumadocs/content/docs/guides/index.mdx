## What is CopilotKit?

CopilotKit is the easiest way to add AI copilots - **intelligent**, **context-aware** assistants - into your app.

CopilotKit connects your app's **logic, state, and user context** to the **AI agents** that deliver the 
animated and interactive part of your app experience â€” across both embedded UIs and fully headless 
interfaces. It gives you the tools to build, deploy, and monitor AI-assisted features that feel intuitive,
helpful, and deeply integrated.

By decoupling your application from any specific model or agent architecture, CopilotKit gives you the freedom to evolve your AI stack without rethinking your user experience.

## Why should you use CopilotKit?
CopilotKit comes with all of the tools you need to begin building your AI application as fast as possible. You can start with a 
simple LLM-only application and, when you're ready, utilize your agentic framework of choice for advanced control.
