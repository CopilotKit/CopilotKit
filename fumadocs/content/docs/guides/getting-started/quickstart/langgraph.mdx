## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

- [**LangSmith API key**](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/administration/how_to_guides/organization_management/create_account_api_key#api-keys)
- [**OpenAI API key**](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

In this guide, we'll have two paths, from scratch or from an existing LangGraph agent.

## From scratch

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Run the CLI
    Just run this following command in your Next.js application to get started!

    <Accordions>
        <Accordion title="Don't have a Next.js application?">
            No problem! Just use `create-next-app` to make one quickly.
            ```bash
            npx create-next-app@latest
            ```
        </Accordion>
    </Accordions>

    ```bash
    npx copilotkit@latest init -m LangGraph
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### ðŸŽ‰ Talk to your agent!

    Congrats! You've successfully integrated a LangGraph agent chatbot to your application. Depending on the
    template you chose, you may see some different UI elements. To start, try asking a few questions to your agent.

    ```
    Can you tell me a joke?
    ```

    ```
    Can you help me understand AI?
    ```

    ```
    What do you think about React?
    ```

    <Accordions className="mb-4">
        <Accordion title="Having trouble?">
            - Make sure your agent folder contains a `langgraph.json` file.
            - In the `langgraph.json` file, reference the path to a `.env` file.
            - In the `.env` file, include your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`.
            - Make sure you're in the same folder as your `langgraph.json` file when running the `langgraph dev` command.
            - Try changing the host to `0.0.0.0` or `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`.
        </Accordion>
