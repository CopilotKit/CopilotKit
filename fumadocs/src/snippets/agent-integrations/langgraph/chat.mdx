import ChatSnippet from "@/snippets/agent-integrations/shared/chat-snippet.mdx";

## Prerequisites
- [Quickstart](/guides/getting-started/quickstart/langgraph) completed

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Select a chat component
    Once you've completed the quickstart, any CopilotKit chat interface will automatically connect to your LangGraph agent!

    In this example, we'll build a [headless](/guides/headless-ui/introduction) chat, but feel free to use any of the [supported chat components](/guides/components/prebuilt)
    to get started even faster.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Create a chat component
    <ChatSnippet components={props.components} />

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Give it a try!
    And you're done! Go ahead and import your chat component anywhere within your `<CopilotKit>` provider
    and you'll be chatting with your LangGraph agent directly.
