As an industry, we are quickly learning (and re-learning) that **AI agents perform best when they work alongside humans**. It's far, far easier to get an agent to excel at specific things, than to perform the given task fully autonomously (see: self-driving cars).

But bridging between humans and AI agents is no small task. Until now.

**CopilotKit’s CoAgents provides infrastructure for connecting LangGraph agents to humans in the loop.**

# Features of a CoAgent

The 4 core features of a CoAgent are as follows:


1. 💨 **Stream intermediate agent state** 
2. 🫱🏻‍🫲🏽 **Shared state between the agent and the application***
3. ❓ **Agent Q&A (wait for input)**
4. 🚘 **Agent Steering**


Let's dig into each of these features!



## 1. Stream Intermediate Agent State

Stream the agent’s intermediate state to the application as the agent executes, so that the user can see work progressing, rather than stare at a loading spinner.

## 2. Shared State Between Agent & Application

Bi-directional syncing between application state and agent state — to allow an agent and a human to collaborate on a task.

```tsx
const { state, setState } = useCoagent();
```

## 3. Agent Q&A (wait for input)

Agents can easily and intentionally ask the user questions. With support for:

- **Text Feedback:** Via the chat UI.
- **Structured (JSON) Feedback:** Via fully custom UI/UX anywhere in your application (chat UI, modals, popups, forms, etc).

## 4. Agent Steering (Coming Soon)

If needed, allow end-users to replay agent execution from a previous checkpoint, as well as correct agent mistakes.
