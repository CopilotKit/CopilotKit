# Copilot Readable State

<Steps>


###  `"use client"` (Next.js App Router)
```tsx filename="YourComponent.tsx"
"use client"  // (only necessary if you are using Next.js App Router)
```

Like other React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect`, this is a **client-side** hook.
If you're using Next.js with the App Router, you'll need to add the `"use client"` directive at the top of any file using this hook.

### `useCopilotReadable`

For your copilot to best answer your customers' needs, you will want to provide it with **context-specific**, **user-specific**, and oftentimes **realtime** data.
CopilotKit makes it easy to do so.

```tsx filename="YourComponent.tsx" showLineNumbers {1, 7-10}
import { useCopilotReadable } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

export function YourComponent() {
  const { colleagues } = useColleagues();

  // Define Copilot readable state
  useCopilotReadable({
    description: "The current user's colleagues",
    value: colleagues,
  });

  return (
    // Your custom UI component
    <>...</>
  );
}
```

### Test it out!
The data your provided is now available to the Copilot.
Test it out by passing some data in the hook and asking the copilot questions about it.
<div className="mt-2 mb-4">
  <img 
    src="/images/connect-your-data-example.gif" 
    alt="Example of connecting data to Copilot" 
    className="rounded-lg shadow-md w-full max-w-md mx-auto"
  />
</div>





</Steps>
