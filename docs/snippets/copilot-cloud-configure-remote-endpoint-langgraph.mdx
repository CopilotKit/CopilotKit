To connect to LangGraph agents through Copilot Cloud, we leverage a concept called "Remote Endpoints"
which allow CopilotKit runtime to connect to various backends.

Navigate to <LinkToCopilotCloud asButton={false}>cloud.copilotkit.ai</LinkToCopilotCloud> and follow the video!

You'll need a LangSmith API key which you can get with [this guide](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/administration/how_to_guides/organization_management/create_account_api_key#create-an-api-key) on LangSmith's website.

<Accordion title="Using LangGraph Studio">

    If you're using a local deployment from LangGraph Studio, you'll need to open a tunnel to your LangGraph Studio deployment URL.

    ```bash
    npx @copilotkit/cli tunnel <port_number> # [!code highlight]
    âœ” Tunnel created successfully!

    Tunnel Information:
    Local: localhost:<port_number>
    Public URL: https://light-pandas-argue.loca.lt # this will be your deployment URL! # [!code highlight]

    Press Ctrl+C to stop the tunnel
    ```
