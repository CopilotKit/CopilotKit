## **Generative UI Specifications**

Several recently released specifications enable agents to return generative UI, increasing the power and flexibility of the Agent-to-User conversation.

**A2UI**, **MCP-UI**, and **Open-JSON-UI** are all generative UI specifications that allow agents to respond to users not only with text but also with dynamic UI components.
CopilotKit now provides universal support for all major Generative UI specifications.

| **Specification** | **Origin / Maintainer** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A2UI** | Google | A declarative, LLM-friendly Generative UI spec. JSONL-based and streaming, designed for platform-agnostic rendering. |
| **Open-JSON-UI** | OpenAI | An open standardization of OpenAI's internal declarative Generative UI schema. |
| **MCP-UI** | Microsoft + Shopify | A fully open, iframe-based Generative UI standard extending MCP for user-facing experiences. |

## **AG-UI vs Generative UI Specs**

Despite the naming similarities, **AG-UI is not a generative UI specification** — it's a **User Interaction protocol** that provides the **bi-directional runtime connection** between the agent and the application.

AG-UI natively supports all of the above generative UI specs and allows developers to define **their own custom generative UI standards** as well.
