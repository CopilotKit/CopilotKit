## What's changed?

### New Look and Feel

CopilotKit 1.8.2 introduces a new default look and feel. This includes new use of theming variables, new components, and generally a fresh look.

**Click the button in the bottom right to see the new look and feel in action!**

### Thumbs Up/Down Handlers

The chat components now have `onThumbsUp` and `onThumbsDown` handlers. Specifying these will add icons to each message
on hover allowing the user to provide feedback.

```tsx
<CopilotChat 
  onThumbsUp={(message) => console.log(message)} 
  onThumbsDown={(message) => console.log(message)}     
/>
```

This was previously achievable in our framework, but we're making it first class now! You can use this to help fine-tune your model through CopilotKit
or just generally track user feedback.

### ResponseButton prop removed

The `ResponseButton` prop has been removed. This was a prop that was used to customize the button that appears after a response was generated
in the chat. 

In its place, we now place buttons below each message for:
- Thumbs up
- Thumbs down
- Copy
- Regenerate

The behvior, icons and styling for each of these buttons can be customized. Checkout our [look and feel guides](/guides/custom-look-and-feel) for more details.

### Out-of-the-box dark mode support

CopilotKit now has out-of-the-box dark mode support. This is controlled by the `.dark` class (Tailwind) as well as the 
`color-scheme` CSS selector.

If you would like to make a custom theme, you can do so by checking out the [custom look and feel](/guides/custom-look-and-feel) guides.
