### Find your CopilotRuntime

The starting point for this section is the `CopilotRuntime` you set up during quickstart (the CopilotKit backend endpoint).
For a refresher, see [Self-Hosting](/guides/self-hosting) (or alternatively, revisit the [quickstart](/quickstart)).

**First, find your `CopilotRuntime` instance in your code.** You can simply search your codebase for `CopilotRuntime`.

If you followed the quickstart, it'll be where you set up the `/api/copilotkit` endpoint.
