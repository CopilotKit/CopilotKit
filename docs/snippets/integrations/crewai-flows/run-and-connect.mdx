import { Accordions, Accordion } from "fumadocs-ui/components/accordion";

You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding.

If you don't already have CopilotKit and your agent connected, choose one of the following options:

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="I already have an agent">
    You can follow the instructions in the [quickstart](/crewai-flows/quickstart) guide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I want to start from scratch">
    You can use the [coagent starter](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/examples/coagents-starter-crewai-flows) as a starting point.

    Alternatively, if you have a Next.js application, run the following command to get started:

    ```bash
    npx copilotkit@latest init -m CrewAI --crew-type Flows
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
