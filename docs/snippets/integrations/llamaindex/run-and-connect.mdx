You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding.

If you don't already have CopilotKit and your agent connected, choose one of the following options:

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="I already have an agent">
    You can follow the instructions in the [quickstart](/llamaindex/quickstart) guide.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I want to start from scratch">
    Run the following command to create a brand new project with a pre-configured agent:

    ```bash
    npx copilotkit@latest create -f llamaindex
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>
