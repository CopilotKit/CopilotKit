Here are various ways to deploy your `LangGraph` agent.

<Tabs items={['Studio (local development)', 'CLI (local development)', 'CLI (self hosted)', 'Platform (cloud)']}>
  <Tab value="Studio (local development)">
    For local deployment during development, you can [use LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/how-tos/test_local_deployment/).
    <Callout type="info">
      To ensure a successful deployment, follow these steps from the LangGraph Studio documentation:
      1. Make sure your agent folder contains a `langgraph.json` file.
      2. In the `langgraph.json` file, reference the path to a `.env` file.
      3. In the `.env` file, include your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`.
    </Callout>

    A successful deployment will yield an API URL (often referred to here as "deployment URL").
    It will generally look like this: `http://localhost:63899`.

    Come back with that URL and a LangSmith API key before proceeding.

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="CLI (local development)">
    For local development, you can use the LangGraph CLI to deploy your LangGraph agent.
    To ensure a successful deployment, follow these steps from the LangGraph CLI documentation:
      1. Make sure your agent folder contains a `langgraph.json` file.
      2. In the `langgraph.json` file, reference the path to a `.env` file.
      3. In the `.env` file, include your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`.
      4. Install the LangGraph CLI: `pip install "langgraph-cli[inmem]>=0.1.55"`
      5. Run agent locally: `langgraph up --port <port> --host 0.0.0.0 --no-browser`
    <Callout type="warn">
      If you are using LangGraph.js, at the moment, you can only run the agent locally using `langgraph up`. LangGraph.js does not support running the agent using development server (`langgraph dev`).
    </Callout>
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="CLI (self hosted)">
    For self-hosting a LangGraph.js agent, follow these steps:

    1. Set up your project structure:
    ```bash
    mkdir my-langgraph-app
    cd my-langgraph-app
    npm init -y
    ```

    2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install @langchain/langgraph
    ```

    3. Create the necessary project files and directories:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p src/utils
    touch src/utils/tools.ts src/utils/nodes.ts src/utils/state.ts src/agent.ts
    touch .env langgraph.json
    ```

    4. Configure your `langgraph.json`:
    ```json
    {
      "node_version": "20",
      "dockerfile_lines": [],
      "dependencies": ["."],
      "graphs": {
        "agent": "./src/agent.ts:graph"
      },
      "env": ".env"
    }
    ```

    5. Create a basic agent implementation in `src/agent.ts`:
    ```typescript
    import { StateGraph, START, END } from '@langchain/langgraph';

    interface MyGraphState {
      // Add your state properties here
    }

    function myNode(state: MyGraphState) {
      return {};
    }

    const graphBuilder = new StateGraph({ channels: {} })
      .addNode('myNode', myNode)
      .addEdge(START, 'myNode')
      .addEdge('myNode', END);

    export const graph = graphBuilder.compile();
    ```

    6. Create a Dockerfile:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM node:20

    WORKDIR /app

    COPY package*.json ./
    RUN npm install

    COPY . .

    CMD ["node", "dist/agent.js"]
    ```

    7. Build and run:
    ```bash
    # Compile TypeScript
    npx tsc

    # Build Docker image
    docker build -t my-langgraph-app .

    # Run the container
    docker run -p 3000:3000 my-langgraph-app
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
      Make sure you have Node.js, npm, TypeScript, and Docker installed on your machine before starting the deployment process.
    </Callout>

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Platform (cloud)">
    For production, you can deploy to LangGraph Platform by following the official [LangGraph Platform deployment guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/cloud/).

    A successful deployment will yield an API URL (often referred to here as "deployment URL").
    It will look like this: `https://{project-identifiers}.langgraph.app`.

    Come back with that URL and a LangSmith API key before proceeding.
