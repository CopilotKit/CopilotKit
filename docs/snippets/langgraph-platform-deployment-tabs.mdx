    <Tab value="LangGraph Studio (local development)">
        For local deployment during development, you can [use LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/how-tos/test_local_deployment/).
        <Callout type="info">
        To ensure a successful deployment, follow these steps from the LangGraph Studio documentation:
        1. Make sure your agent folder contains a `langgraph.json` file.
        2. In the `langgraph.json` file, reference the path to a `.env` file.
        3. In the `.env` file, include your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`.
        </Callout>

        A successful deployment will yield an API URL (often referred to here as "deployment URL"). 
        It will generally look like this: `http://localhost:63899`.

        Come back with that URL and a LangSmith API key before proceeding.

    <Tab value="LangGraph Platform (cloud)">
        For production, you can deploy to LangGraph Platform by following the official [LangGraph Platform deployment guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/cloud/).

        A successful deployment will yield an API URL (often referred to here as "deployment URL"). 
        It will look like this: `https://{project-identifiers}.langgraph.app`.

        Come back with that URL and a LangSmith API key before proceeding.
