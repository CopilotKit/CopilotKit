    <Tab value="LangGraph Studio (local development)">
        For local deployment during development, you can [use LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/how-tos/test_local_deployment/).
        <Callout type="info">
        To ensure a successful deployment, follow these steps from the LangGraph Studio documentation:
        1. Make sure your agent folder contains a `langgraph.json` file.
        2. In the `langgraph.json` file, reference the path to a `.env` file.
        3. In the `.env` file, include your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`.
        </Callout>

        A successful deployment will yield an API URL (often referred to here as "deployment URL").
        It will generally look like this: `http://localhost:63899`.

        Come back with that URL and a LangSmith API key before proceeding.

    <Tab value="LangGraph CLI (local development)">
        For local development, you can use the LangGraph CLI to deploy your LangGraph agent.
        To ensure a successful deployment, follow these steps from the LangGraph CLI documentation:
            1. Make sure your agent folder contains a `langgraph.json` file.
            2. In the `langgraph.json` file, reference the path to a `.env` file.
            3. In the `.env` file, include your `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`.
            4. Install the LangGraph CLI: `pip install "langgraph-cli[inmem]>=0.1.55"`
            5. Run agent locally: `langgraph up --port <port> --host 0.0.0.0 --no-browser`
        <Callout type="warn">
            If you are using LangGraph.js, at the moment, you can only run the agent locally using `langgraph up`. LangGraph.js does not support running the agent using development server (`langgraph dev`).
        </Callout>
    </Tab>

    <Tab value="LangGraph Platform (cloud)">
        For production, you can deploy to LangGraph Platform by following the official [LangGraph Platform deployment guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/cloud/).

        A successful deployment will yield an API URL (often referred to here as "deployment URL").
        It will look like this: `https://{project-identifiers}.langgraph.app`.

        Come back with that URL and a LangSmith API key before proceeding.
