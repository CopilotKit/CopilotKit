## What is shared state?

CoAgents maintain a shared state that seamlessly connects your UI with the agent's execution. In the case of CrewAI Crews, the shared state system allows you to:

- Update and send the `inputs` of the crew to the agent
- Receive the `outputs` of the crew
- React to state changes in real-time across your application

## When should I use this?

Shared state is perfect when you want to facilitate collaboration between your agent and the user. Updates to the outputs will be automatically shared by the UI. Similarly, any `inputs` that the user updates in the UI will be automatically reflected in the crews execution.

This allows for a consistent experience where both the agent and the user are on the same page.
