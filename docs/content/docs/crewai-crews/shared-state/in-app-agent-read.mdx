## What is this?

You can easily use the realtime agent state in the native application UX.

## When should I use this?

You can use this when you want to provide the user with a way to read the outputs of a CrewAI Crew from your application.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Run and Connect Your Agent to CopilotKit

    You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding. If you haven't done so already,
    you can follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide.

    If you don't already have an agent, you can use the [coagent starter](https://github.com/copilotkit/copilotkit/tree/main/examples/coagent-starter-crewai-crews) as a starting point
    as this guide uses it as a starting point.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Use the `useCoAgent` Hook
    With your agent connected and running all that is left is to call the [useCoAgent](/reference/hooks/useCoAgent) hook, pass the agent's name, and
    optionally provide an initial state.

    ```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
    import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]

    // Define the agent state type, should match the actual state of your agent
    

    function YourMainContent() {
      const { state } = useCoAgent({
        name: "research_crew",
        initialState: {
          inputs: {
            topic: "",
            current_year: "2025",
          },
          outputs: "Report will appear here",
        },
      });

      // ...

      return (
        // style excluded for brevity
        <div>
          <h1>Your report:</h1>
          <p>{state.outputs}</p> // [!code highlight]
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    <Callout type="info">
      The `state` in `useCoAgent` is reactive and will automatically update when the agent's state changes.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Give it a try!
    As the agent state updates, your `state` variable will automatically update with it! In this case, you'll see the report update when the crew is done running.
