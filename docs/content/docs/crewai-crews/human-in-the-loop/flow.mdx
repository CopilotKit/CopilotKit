<Callout type="info">
  Pictured above is the [coagent starter](https://github.com/copilotkit/copilotkit/tree/main/examples/coagent-starter-crewai-crews) with
  the implementation below applied!
</Callout>

## What is this?
[Crew based agents](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/crews) are stateful agents that can be interrupted and resumed to allow for user input.

CopilotKit lets you to add custom UI to take user input and then pass it back to the agent upon completion.

## Why should I use this?

Human-in-the-loop is a powerful way to implement complex workflows that are production ready. By having a human in the loop, you can ensure that the agent is always making the right decisions and ultimately is being steered in the right direction.

Crew based agents are a great way to implement HITL for more complex workflows where you want to ensure the agent is aware of everything that has happened during a HITL interaction.

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Run and connect your agent

        You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding. If you haven't done so already, you can follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](/crewai-crews/quickstart/crewai) guide.

        If you don't already have an agent, you can use the [coagent starter](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/examples/coagents-starter-crewai-crews) as a starting point
        as this guide uses it as a starting point.
    </Step>
    
    <Step>
      ### Install the CopilotKit SDK
      <InstallSDKSnippet components={props.components}/>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Add a `useCopilotAction` to your Frontend
        First, we'll create a component that displays the arguments of the crew and waits for user approval.

        ```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
        import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core"
        import { Markdown } from "@copilotkit/react-ui"

        function YourMainContent() {
          // ...

          useCopilotAction({ 
            name: "confirmKickoffCrew",
            available: "remote",
            description: "Confirm the kickoff of the crew. You MUST call this tool before the crew can continue.",
            parameters: [
              { name: "jsonArguments", type: "string", description: "The JSON input to the crew", required: true },
            ],
            // [!code highlight:25]
            renderAndWaitForResponse: ({ args, respond, status }) => {
              return (
                <div>
                  <pre>{args.jsonArguments}</pre>
                  
                  <div className={`flex gap-4 pt-4 ${status !== "executing" ? "hidden" : ""}`}>
                    <button 
                      onClick={() => respond?.("CANCEL")}
                      disabled={status !== "executing"}
                      className="border p-2 rounded-xl w-full"
                    >
                      Cancel
                    </button>
                    <button
                      onClick={() => respond?.("KICKOFF")}
                      disabled={status !== "executing"} 
                      className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded-xl w-full"
                    >
                      Approve Kickoff
                    </button>
                  </div>
                </div>
              );
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Setup the CrewAI Agent
    Now we'll setup the CrewAI agent. The actions defined on the frontend are made automatically available to the agent.

    <Tabs groupId="language" items={["Python"]}>
      <Tab value="Python">
        ```python title="agent/sample_agent/agent.py"
        sdk = CopilotKitRemoteEndpoint(
            agents=[
                CrewAIAgent(
                    name="research_crew",
                    description="Research agent",
                    crew=ResearchCrew(),
                ),
            ],
        )
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        Try giving the crew enough information to complete the task, i.e. "Research the state of AI in 2025". You should see the custom UI component that allows you to approve or cancel the kickoff of the crew.
    </Step>
