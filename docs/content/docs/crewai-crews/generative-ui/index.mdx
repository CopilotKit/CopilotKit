## What is Generative UI?

Generative UI lets you render your agent's state, progress, outputs, and tool calls with custom UI components in real-time. It bridges the gap between AI
agents and user interfaces. As your agent processes information and makes decisions, you can render custom UI components that:

- Show loading states and progress indicators
- Display structured data in tables, cards, or charts
- Create interactive elements for user input
- Animate transitions between different states

## Ready-to-Use UI Components

CopilotKit provides built-in UI components specifically designed for CrewAI applications:

<CTACards
  columns={1}
  cards={[
    {
      icon: LuLayoutTemplate,
      title: "UI Components Library",
      description:
        "Ready-to-use components for rendering agent state and collecting user feedback.",
      href: "/crewai-crews/components",
    },
  ]}
/>

These components are designed to work seamlessly with CrewAI crews and provide a great starting point for building generative UIs.

## How can I use this?

There are two main variants of Generative UI.

<CTACards
  columns={2}
  cards={[
    {
      icon: Bot,
      title: "Agentic",
      description:
        "Render your agent's state, progress, and outputs with custom UI components.",
      href: "/crewai-crews/generative-ui/agentic",
    },
    {
      icon: Wrench,
      title: "Tool-based",
      description: "Render your agent's tool calls with custom UI components.",
      href: "/crewai-crews/generative-ui/tool-based",
    },
  ]}
/>
