## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

- [**OpenAI API key**](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

## Getting started

        >
            <Step>
                ### Find your CrewAI Enterprise credentials
                Login to [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) and grab your Crew's URL and Bearer token.

                Don't have a deployed Crew? Check out the [templates](https://app.crewai.com/crewai_plus/templates) to get started quickly.
            </Step>

            <TailoredContent
                className="step"
                id="cli"
                header={
                    <div>

                >
                    <Step>
                        ### Run the CLI
                        Just run this following command in your Next.js application to get started!

                        <Accordions>
                            <Accordion title="Don't have a Next.js application?">
                                No problem! Just use `create-next-app` to make one quickly.
                                ```bash
                                npx create-next-app@latest
                                ```
                            </Accordion>
                        </Accordions>

                        ```bash
                        npx copilotkit@latest init
                        ```
                    </Step>

                </TailoredContentOption>
                <TailoredContentOption
                    id="do-it-manually"
                    title="Code along"
                    description="I want to deeply understand what's happening under the hood or don't have a Next.js application."
                    icon={<SquareChartGantt />}
                >
                    <Step>
                        ### Connect to Copilot Cloud
                        1. Go to [Copilot Cloud](https://cloud.copilotkit.ai), sign in and click Get Started
                        2. Add your OpenAI API key to the "Provide OpenAI API Key" section
                        3. Click "Add Remote Endpoint" and fill in the details of your Crew. Note: If your Agent Name contains multiple words, use underscores (`_`) as separators.
                        4. Click "Save Endpoint"
                        5. Copy the Copilot Cloud Public API Key

                        <img src="/images/copilot-cloud/crew-cpk-setup.gif" alt="CrewAI Copilot Setup" className="rounded-lg shadow-xl mt-4" />
                    </Step>

                    <Step>
                        ## Setup the CopilotKit Provider
                        The [`<CopilotKit>`](/reference/components/CopilotKit) component must wrap the Copilot-aware parts of your application. For most use-cases,
                        it's appropriate to wrap the CopilotKit provider around the entire app, e.g. in your layout.tsx.
                        <CloudCopilotKitProvider components={props.components} />
                    </Step>
                    <Step>
                        ## Choose a Copilot UI
                        You are almost there! Now it's time to setup your Copilot UI.
                        <CopilotUI components={props.components} />
                    </Step>
                    <Step>
                        ## Create a Crew-Quickstart component
                        Place the following snippet in your **main page** (e.g. `page.tsx` in Next.js) or wherever you want to use CopilotKit. It simply imports the `QuickstartCrew` component from our **crew-quickstart.tsx** file and renders it.

                        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
                        "use client";
                        import React from "react";
                        import useCrewQuickstart from "./use-crew-quickstart";

                        export default function YourApp() {
                        useCrewQuickstart({
                            crewName: "<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CREW_NAME>",
                            /**
                             * List of input required to start your crew (location e.g)
                            */
                            inputs: ["location"]
                        })
                        return (
                            <>
                            {/* Existing markup */}
                            </>
                        );
                        }
                        ```
                        <CrewQuickStart components={props.components} />
                    </Step>
                </TailoredContentOption>
            </TailoredContent>
            <Step>
                ### 🎉 Talk to your agent!
                Congrats! You've successfully integrated your CrewAI Enterprise agent with CopilotKit.
                Try talking to your Copilot. Chat with it to provide the information needed to run your Crew from your app.

                You can also check out our [Restaurant Finder Crew demo](https://crew-ai-enterprise-demo.vercel.app) to see implementation in action.
