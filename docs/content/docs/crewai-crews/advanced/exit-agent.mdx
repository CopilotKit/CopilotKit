After your agent has finished running a crew, it will automatically exit the agent loop

Exiting the agent has different effects depending on mode:

- **Router Mode**: Exiting the agent hands responsibility for handling input back to the router, which can initiate chat, call actions, other agents, etc. The router can return to this agent later (starting a new loop) to satisfy a user request.

- **Agent Lock Mode**: Exiting the agent restarts the workflow loop for the current agent.
