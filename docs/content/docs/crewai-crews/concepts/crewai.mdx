CrewAI is an agentic framework for building LLM applications that can be used with Copilotkit. CrewAi Flows allow developers
to combine and coordinate coding tasks and Crews efficiently, providing a robust framework for building sophisticated AI automations.

## CoAgents and CrewAI

How do CoAgents extend CrewAI? Let's read the first sentence of their [page on Flows](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/flows) to understand.

> Flows allow you to create structured, event-driven workflows. They provide a seamless way to connect multiple tasks, manage state, and control the flow of execution in your AI applications.

Let's break down some key terms and understand how they relate to and are implemented by CoAgents.

- **Manage state**: CoAgents have bi-directional state sharing with the agent and UI. This allows for the agent to remember
  information from previous messages and the UI to update the agent with new information. Read more about how state sharing works
  [here](/crewai-crews/shared-state).
- **Multi-actor**: CoAgents allow for multiple agents to interact with each other. Copilotkit acts as the "ground-truth"
  when transitioning between agents. Read more about how multi-actor workflows work [here](/crewai-crews/multi-agent-flows)
  and how messages are managed [here](/crewai-crews/concepts/message-management).
- **LLMs**: CoAgents use large language models to generate responses. This is useful for building applications that need to
  generate natural language responses.

Some additional functionality not mentioned here is:

- **Human in the loop**: CoAgents enabled human review and approval of generated responses. Read more about how this works
  [here](/crewai-crews/human-in-the-loop).
- **Tool calling**: Tool calling is a fundamental building block for agentic workflows. They allow for greater control over what
  the agent can do and can be used to interact with external systems. CoAgents allow you to easily render in-progress
  tool calls in the UI so your users know what's happening. Read more about streaming tool calls [here](/crewai-crews/shared-state/predictive-state-updates).

## Building with Python

You can build CrewAI applications using Python. Check out the [CrewAI docs](https://docs.crewai.com/introduction) for more information.

## CrewAI Enterprise

Turn any crew into an API within seconds
Connect to your apps using hooks, REST, gRPC and more
Get access to templates, custom tools and early UI
Get business support, SLA, private VPC

CrewAI enterprise is a platform for deploying and monitoring CrewAI applications. Read more about it on the
[CrewAI website](https://www.crewai.com/enterprise).

If you want to take the next step to deploy your CrewAI application as an CoAgent, check out our [quickstart guide](/crewai-crews/quickstart/crewai).
