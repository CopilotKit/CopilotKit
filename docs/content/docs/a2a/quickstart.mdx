## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

- A Google Gemini API key
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.9+
- Your favorite package manager

## Getting started

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Clone the A2A starter template

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/copilotkit/with-a2a-a2ui.git
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Install dependencies

        ```
        pnpm install
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Configure your environment

        Create a `.env` file in your agent directory and add your Google API key:

        ```plaintext title="agent/.env"
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
        ```

        <Callout type="info" title="What about other models?">
          The starter template is configured to use Google's Gemini by default, but you can modify it to use any language model supported by ADK.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Start the development server

        <Tabs groupId="package-manager" items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
            <Tab value="npm">
                ```bash
                npm run dev
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="pnpm">
                ```bash
                pnpm dev
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="yarn">
                ```bash
                yarn dev
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="bun">
                ```bash
                bun dev
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        This will start both the UI and agent servers concurrently.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### 🎉 Start chatting!

        Your AI agent is now ready to use! Navigate to `localhost:3000` and start prompting it:

        ```
        Show me chinese restaurants in NYC
        ```

        <Accordions className="mb-4">
            <Accordion title="Troubleshooting">
                - If you're having connection issues, try using `0.0.0.0` or `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`
                - Make sure your agent is running on port 8000
                - Check that your Google API key is correctly set
            </Accordion>
        </Accordions>

    </Step>
</Steps>
