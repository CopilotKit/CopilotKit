Vercel AI SDK is a framework for building AI-powered applications with React that can be used with CopilotKit. Vercel AI SDK provides developers
with powerful tools to build sophisticated AI applications with streaming, tool calling, and multi-model support.

## CoAgents and Vercel AI SDK

How do CoAgents extend Vercel AI SDK?


- **Multi-model**: CoAgents allow for multiple AI models to be used in a single application. CopilotKit acts as the "ground-truth"
  when transitioning between models. Read more about how multi-model workflows work [here](/vercel-ai-sdk/multi-model-flows)
  and how messages are managed [here](/vercel-ai-sdk/concepts/message-management).
- **Streaming**: CoAgents use streaming to provide real-time responses. This is useful for building applications that need to
  generate natural language responses in real-time.
- **Human in the loop**: CoAgents enabled human review and approval of generated responses. Read more about how this works
  [here](/vercel-ai-sdk/human-in-the-loop).
- **Tool calling**: Tool calling is a fundamental building block for agentic workflows. They allow for greater control over what
  the agent can do and can be used to interact with external systems. CoAgents allow you to easily render in-progress
  tool calls in the UI so your users know what's happening. Read more about streaming tool calls [here](/vercel-ai-sdk/frontend-actions).

## Building with TypeScript

You can build Vercel AI SDK applications using TypeScript. Check out the [Vercel AI SDK docs](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) for more information.

## Vercel AI SDK Features

Vercel AI SDK provides a comprehensive set of features for building AI applications. Read more about it on the
[Vercel AI SDK website](https://sdk.vercel.ai/).

If you want to take the next step to deploy your Vercel AI SDK application as an CoAgent, check out our [quickstart guide](/vercel-ai-sdk/quickstart).
