## Implementation

<Callout>
Check out the [Frontend Tools overview](/frontend-tools) to understand what they are and when to use them.
</Callout>

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Setup CopilotKit

        To use frontend tools, you'll need to setup CopilotKit first. For the sake of brevity, we won't cover it here.

        Check out our [getting started guide](/vercel-ai-sdk/quickstart) and come back here when you're setup!
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend tool

        First, you'll need to create a frontend tool using the [useCopilotAction](/reference/hooks/useCopilotAction) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:15]
          useCopilotAction({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler: async ({ name }) => {
              alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Accessing Frontend Tools

        Since Vercel AI SDK includes native support for the AG-UI protocol, frontend tools are automatically available to the agent as
        tools.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any frontend tools you've defined. These tools will be available to the agent where they can be used as needed.
    </Step>
