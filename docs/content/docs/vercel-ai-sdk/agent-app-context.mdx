## What is this?

One of the most common use cases for CopilotKit is to register app state and context using `useCopilotReadble`.
This way, you can notify your agent of what is going in your app in real time.

## When should I use this?

You can use this when you want to provide the user with feedback about what your working memory. As your agent's 
state update you can reflect these updates natively in your application.

Some examples might be: the current user, the current page, etc. This be shared with your agent in real time.

## Implementation
<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Wrap your data in a readable

        The [`useCopilotReadable` hook](/reference/hooks/useCopilotReadable) is used to add data as context to the Copilot.

        ```tsx title="YourComponent.tsx" showLineNumbers {1, 7-10}
        "use client" // only necessary if you are using Next.js with the App Router. // [!code highlight]
        import { useCopilotReadable } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]
        import { useState } from 'react';

        export function YourComponent() {
            // Create colleagues state with some sample data
            const [colleagues, setColleagues] = useState([
                { id: 1, name: "John Doe", role: "Developer" },
                { id: 2, name: "Jane Smith", role: "Designer" },
                { id: 3, name: "Bob Wilson", role: "Product Manager" }
            ]);

            // Define Copilot readable state
            // [!code highlight:4]
            useCopilotReadable({
                description: "The current user's colleagues",
                value: colleagues,
            });
            return (
                // Your custom UI component
                <>...</>
            );
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Use the data in your Vercel AI SDK agent

        Vercel AI SDK automatically receives the context from CopilotKit through the chat function.
        The context is available in your chat handler and can be used to provide more intelligent responses.

        ```tsx title="api/copilotkit/route.ts"
        import { CopilotRuntime, OpenAIAdapter } from "@copilotkit/runtime";
        import { streamText } from "ai";
        import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

        const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
          chat: async ({ messages, tools, context }) => {
            // Context from useCopilotReadable is available here
            const colleaguesContext = context?.find(ctx => 
              ctx.description === 'The current user\'s colleagues'
            );
            
            const result = await streamText({
              model: openai("gpt-4o"),
              messages: [
                {
                  role: "system",
                  content: `You are a helpful assistant that can help emailing colleagues.
                  The user's colleagues are: ${colleaguesContext?.value || 'No colleagues data available'}`
                },
                ...messages
              ],
              tools,
            });
            
            return result.toDataStreamResponse();
          },
        });

        export const POST = async (req: Request) => {
          return runtime.response(req);
        };
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        Ask your agent a question about the context. It should be able to answer!
    </Step>
