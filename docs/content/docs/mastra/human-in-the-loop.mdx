## What is this?

CopilotKit lets you to add custom UI to take user input and then pass it back to the agent upon completion.

<Callout type="warning">
Calling `suspend()` or `resume()` inside of a workflow is not currently supported in this integration.
</Callout>

## Why should I use this?

Human-in-the-loop is a powerful way to implement complex workflows that are production ready. By having a human in the loop,
you can ensure that the agent is always making the right decisions and ultimately is being steered in the right direction.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Run and connect your agent
    <RunAndConnect components={props.components} />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add a `useCopilotAction` to your Frontend
    First, we'll create a component that renders the agent's essay draft and waits for user approval.

    ```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
    import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core"
    import { Markdown } from "@copilotkit/react-ui"

    function YourMainContent() {
      // ...

      useCopilotAction({
        name: "writeEssay",
        available: "remote",
        description: "Writes an essay and takes the draft as an argument.",
        parameters: [
          { name: "draft", type: "string", description: "The draft of the essay", required: true },
        ],
        // [!code highlight:25]
        renderAndWaitForResponse: ({ args, respond, status }) => {
          return (
            <div>
              <Markdown content={args.draft || 'Preparing your draft...'} />

              <div className={`flex gap-4 pt-4 ${status !== "executing" ? "hidden" : ""}`}>
                <button
                  onClick={() => respond?.("CANCEL")}
                  disabled={status !== "executing"}
                  className="border p-2 rounded-xl w-full"
                >
                  Try Again
                </button>
                <button
                  onClick={() => respond?.("SEND")}
                  disabled={status !== "executing"}
                  className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded-xl w-full"
                >
                  Approve Draft
                </button>
              </div>
            </div>
          );
        },
      });

      // ...
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Setup the Mastra Agent
    On the agent side, we are already done! Mastra natively supports the AG-UI protocol and will automatically
    pass control back to the frontend when the `writeEssay` action is found in the model's response.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Give it a try!
    Try asking your agent to write an essay about the benefits of AI. You'll see that it will generate an essay,
    stream the progress and eventually ask you to review it.
