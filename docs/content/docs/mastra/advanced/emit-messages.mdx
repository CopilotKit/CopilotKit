While most agent interactions happen automatically through shared state updates as the agent runs, you can also **manually send messages from within your agent code** to provide immediate feedback to users.

## What is this?

In Mastra, messages are only emitted when a function is completed. CopilotKit allows you to manually emit messages
in the middle of a function's execution to provide immediate feedback to the user.

## When should I use this?

Manually emitted messages are great for **when you don't want to wait for the function** to complete **and you**:

- Have a long running task that you want to provide feedback on
- Want to provide a status update to the user
- Want to provide a warning or error message

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Run and Connect Your Agent to CopilotKit
        <RunAndConnectSnippet />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Install the CopilotKit SDK
        <InstallSDKSnippet components={props.components}/>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Manually emit a message
        The `copilotkit_emit_message` method allows you to emit messages early in a functions's execution to communicate status updates to the user. This is particularly useful for long running tasks.

            <Tab value="Python">
                ```python
                # your code goes here...
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        Now when you talk to your agent you'll notice that it immediately responds with the message "Thinking really hard..."
        before giving you a response 2 seconds later.
