## What is this?
Frontend tools enable you to define client-side functions that your Mastra agent can invoke, with execution happening entirely in the user's browser. When your agent calls a frontend tool,
the logic runs on the client side, giving you direct access to the frontend environment.

This can be utilized to let [your agent control the UI](/mastra/frontend-actions), [generative UI](/mastra/generative-ui/frontend-tools), or for Human-in-the-loop interactions.

In this guide, we cover the use of frontend tools for generative UI.

## When should I use this?
Use frontend tools when you need your agent to interact with client-side primitives such as:
- Reading or modifying React component state
- Accessing browser APIs like localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies
- Triggering UI updates or animations
- Interacting with third-party frontend libraries
- Performing actions that require the user's immediate browser context

## Implementation

    <Step>
      ### Run and connect your agent
      <RunAndConnect components={props.components} />
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend tool

        First, you'll need to create a frontend tool using the [useFrontendTool](/reference/hooks/useFrontendTool) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useFrontendTool } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:25]
          useFrontendTool({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler({ name }) {
              // Handler returns the result of the tool call
              return { currentURLPath: window.location.href, userName: name };
            },
            render: ({ args }) => {
              // Renders UI based on the data of the tool call
              return (
                <div>
                  <h1>Hello, {args.name}!</h1>
                  <h1>You're currently on {window.location.href}</h1>
                </div>
              );
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Setup your Mastra agent with frontend tools

        Frontend tools registered with `useFrontendTool` are automatically forwarded to your agent through the AG-UI protocol. The agent can invoke them, and execution happens on the frontend.

        ```ts title="src/mastra/agents/index.ts"
        import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
        import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

        export const myAgent = new Agent({
          name: "My Agent",
          instructions: "You are a helpful assistant!",
          model: openai("gpt-4o"),
        });

        // Frontend tools are automatically available to the agent
        // through the AG-UI protocol when registered with useFrontendTool
        ```

        <Callout type="info">
          Frontend tools registered with `useFrontendTool` are automatically forwarded to your agent through the AG-UI protocol. The agent can invoke them, and execution happens on the frontend.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any frontend tools you've defined. These tools will be available to the agent where they can be used as needed.
