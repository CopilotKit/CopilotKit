## What is this?

Frontend actions are powerful tools that allow your AI agents to directly interact with and update your application's user interface. Think of them as bridges that connect your agent's decision-making capabilities with your frontend's interactive elements.

## When should I use this?

Frontend actions are essential when you want to create truly interactive AI applications where your agent needs to:

- Dynamically update UI elements
- Trigger frontend animations or transitions
- Show alerts or notifications
- Modify application state
- Handle user interactions programmatically

Without frontend actions, agents are limited to just processing and returning data. By implementing frontend actions, you can create rich, interactive experiences where your agent actively drives the user interface.

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Setup CopilotKit

        To use frontend actions, you'll need to setup CopilotKit first. For the sake of brevity, we won't cover it here.

        Check out our [getting started guide](/mastra/quickstart/mastra) and come back here when you're setup!
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend action

        First, you'll need to create a frontend action using the [useCopilotAction](/reference/hooks/useCopilotAction) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:16]
          useCopilotAction({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            available: "remote", // optional, makes it so the action is *only* available to the agent
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler: async ({ name }) => {
              alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ###  Modify your agent
        Now, we'll need to modify the agent to access these frontend actions. Open up for your agent's folder and continue from there!
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Install the CopilotKit SDK
        <InstallSDKSnippet components={props.components}/>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Accessing Frontend Actions

        Since Mastra includes native support for the AG-UI protocol, frontend actions are automatically available to the agent as
        tools.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any CopilotActions you've defined. These actions will be available as tools to the agent where they can be used as needed.
    </Step>
