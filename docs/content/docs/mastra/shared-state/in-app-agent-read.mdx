## What is this?

You can easily use the realtime agent state not only in the chat UI, but also in the native application UX.

## When should I use this?

You can use this when you want to provide the user with feedback about what your working memory. As your agent's 
state update you can reflect these updates natively in your application.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Run and Connect Your Agent to CopilotKit

    You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding.

    #### I already have an agent

    You can follow the instructions in the [quickstart](/mastra/quickstart) guide.
    
    #### I want to start from scratch

    Run the following command to create a brand new project with a pre-configured agent:

    ```bash
    npx copilotkit@latest create -f mastra
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Define the Agent State
    Mastra has advanced [working memory concepts](https://mastra.ai/en/docs/memory/working-memory) to provide statefulness to your agents. CopilotKit leverages Mastra's working memory concept to allow you to
    implement shared state between your agent and your application.

    Providing working memory to your agent is as simple as providing a Zod schema to your agent.

    ```ts title="mastra/agents/language-agent.ts"
    import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
    import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
    import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";
    import { z } from "zod";
    import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";

    // [!code highlight:5]
    // 1. Define the agent state schema
    export const AgentStateSchema = z.object({
      language: z.enum(["english", "spanish"]),
    });

    // 2. Infer the agent state type from the schema
    export const AgentState = z.infer<typeof AgentStateSchema>;

    // 3. Create the agent
    export const languageAgent = new Agent({
      name: "Language Agent",
      model: openai("gpt-4o"),
      instructions: "You are a helpful assistant that can help the user with their language.",
      memory: new Memory({
        storage: new LibSQLStore({ url: "file::memory:" }),
        options: {
          // [!code highlight:5]
          workingMemory: {
            enabled: true,
            schema: AgentStateSchema,
          },
        },
      }),
    });
    ```    
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Use the `useCoAgent` Hook
    With your agent connected and running all that is left is to call the [useCoAgent](/reference/hooks/useCoAgent) hook, pass the agent's name, and
    optionally provide an initial state.

    ```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
    import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]
    import { AgentState } from "@/mastra/agents/language-agent";

    function YourMainContent() {
      const { state } = useCoAgent<AgentState>({ // [!code highlight:5]
        name: "language_agent",
        // optionally provide a type-safe initial state
        initialState: { language: "spanish" }  
      });

      // ...

      return (
        // style excluded for brevity
        <div>
          <h1>Your main content</h1>
          // [!code highlight:2]
          <p>Language: {state.language}</p> 
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    <Callout type="info">
      The `state` in `useCoAgent` is reactive and will automatically update when the working memory changes.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Give it a try!
    As the agent state updates, your `state` variable will automatically update with it! In this case, you'll see the
    language set to "spanish" as that's the initial state we set.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rendering agent state in the chat

You can also render the working memory in the chat UI. This is useful for informing the user about the working memory in a 
more in-context way. To do this, you can use the [useCoAgentStateRender](/reference/hooks/useCoAgentStateRender) hook.

```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
import { useCoAgentStateRender } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]

// Define the agent state type, should match the actual state of your agent
type AgentState = {
  language: "english" | "spanish";
}

function YourMainContent() {
  // ...
  // [!code highlight:8]
  useCoAgentStateRender({
    name: "sample_agent",
    render: ({ state }) => {
      if (!state.language) return null;
      return <div>Language: {state.language}</div>;
    },
  });
  // ...
}
```
