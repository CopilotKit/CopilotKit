Agno is a full-stack framework for building Multi-Agent Systems with memory, knowledge and reasoning.  CopilotKit and AGNO together provide everything you need to build rich, interactive, agent-powered applications.

With full user-interaction infrastructure, you can create copilots that are not just smart, but truly collaborative.  This means that your agentic application can:
* Respond quickly and often to user input
* Allow the user to steer as needed
* Take action on the user's behalf, driving the app, or other tools through MCP

## Generative UI

Generative UI lets you render your agent's state, progress, outputs, and tool calls with custom UI components in real-time. It bridges the gap between AI agents and user interfaces. <a href="/agno/generative-ui" className="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-800 dark:hover:text-blue-300 hover:font-bold transition-colors">Learn More</a>

## Shared State

Keep your agent and your app in sync. Shared state means your agent can see everything in your app, and your app can react to your agent.

## Live Demo - Agno x CopilotKit in Action

In this example, we've built an agentic travel assistant that can you help you plan your next trip. It uses AGNO
to coordinate chat and task execution.
