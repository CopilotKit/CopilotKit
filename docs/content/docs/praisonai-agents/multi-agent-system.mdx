# Multi-agent System

This example uses two specialized agents that work together to produce comprehensive research:

## Agent Roles

### Researcher Agent
```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

researcher = Agent(
    instructions="Conduct thorough research on topics. Find relevant and current information."
)
```

The Researcher Agent:
- Analyzes the research topic
- Gathers key information
- Produces structured findings

### Reporting Analyst
```python
reporting_analyst = Agent(
    instructions="Create detailed, structured reports from research findings."
)
```

The Reporting Analyst:
- Takes researcher's findings
- Organizes information
- Creates comprehensive reports

## Agent Coordination

```python
from praisonaiagents import PraisonAIAgents

agents = PraisonAIAgents(
    agents=[researcher, reporting_analyst]
)
```

The agents work sequentially:
1. Researcher conducts initial research
2. Reporting Analyst creates final report
3. Results stream to the UI in real-time

## Example Usage

```python
# Define research topic
topic = "Artificial Intelligence in 2025"

# Start the research process
result = agents.start(topic)
```

The UI will show real-time progress as agents work through these steps.
