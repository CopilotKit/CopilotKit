This component will typically wrap your entire application (or a sub-tree of your application where you want to have a copilot). It provides the copilot context to all other components and hooks.
 
## Example
 
You can find more information about self-hosting CopilotKit [here](/guides/self-hosting).
 
```tsx
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
 
<CopilotKit runtimeUrl="<your-runtime-url>">
  // ... your app ...
</CopilotKit>
```
