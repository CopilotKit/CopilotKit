This hook is used to integrate an agent into your application. With its use, you can
render and update the state of an agent, allowing for a dynamic and interactive experience.
We call these shared state experiences agentic copilots, or CoAgents for short.
 
## Usage
 
### Simple Usage
 
```tsx
import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
 
type AgentState = {
  count: number;
}
 
const agent = useCoAgent<AgentState>({
  name: "my-agent",
  initialState: {
    count: 0,
  },
});
 
```
 
`useCoAgent` returns an object with the following properties:
 
```tsx
const {
  name,     // The name of the agent currently being used.
  nodeName, // The name of the current LangGraph node.
  state,    // The current state of the agent.
  setState, // A function to update the state of the agent.
  running,  // A boolean indicating if the agent is currently running.
  start,    // A function to start the agent.
  stop,     // A function to stop the agent.
  run,      // A function to re-run the agent. Takes a HintFunction to inform the agent why it is being re-run.
} = agent;
```
 
Finally we can leverage these properties to create reactive experiences with the agent!
 
```tsx
const { state, setState } = useCoAgent<AgentState>({
  name: "my-agent",
  initialState: {
    count: 0,
  },
});
 
return (
  <div>
    <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
    <button onClick={() => setState({ count: state.count + 1 })}>Increment</button>
  </div>
);
```
 
This reactivity is bidirectional, meaning that changes to the state from the agent will be reflected in the UI and vice versa.
