## Implementation

<Callout>
Check out the [Frontend Actions overview](/frontend-actions) to understand what they are and when to use them.

    <Step>
        ### Setup CopilotKit

        To use frontend actions, you'll need to setup CopilotKit first. For the sake of brevity, we won't cover it here.

        Check out our [getting started guide](/llamaindex/quickstart/llamaindex) and come back here when you're setup!
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Add a tool to your agent
        Add a tool to your agent that will be used to say hello to the user. Since the tool will be used in the frontend,
        we'll add it to the `frontend_tools` list.

        ```python title="agent-py/agent/agent.py"
        from llama_index.protocols.ag_ui.router import get_ag_ui_workflow_router
        from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
        from fastapi import FastAPI

        def say_hello(name: str) -> str:
            """Says hello to the user and takes the name as an argument."""
            return f"Hello, {name}!"

        app = FastAPI()

        router = get_ag_ui_workflow_router(
            llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-4.1"),
            frontend_tools=[say_hello],
        )

        app.include_router(router)

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            import uvicorn
            uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend action

        First, you'll need to create a frontend action using the [useCopilotAction](/reference/hooks/useCopilotAction) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:16]
          useCopilotAction({
            name: "say_hello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler: async ({ name }) => {
              alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        Your front-end tool will now be executed on the front-end when the it decides to call the `say_hello` action.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Try it out!
        Navigate to the front-end and try it out!

        ```
        Say hello to the John
        ```
    </Step>
