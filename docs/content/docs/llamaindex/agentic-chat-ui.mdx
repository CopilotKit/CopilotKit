## What is this?

Agentic chat UIs are ways for your users to interact with your agent. CopilotKit provides a variety of different components to choose from, each
with their own unique use cases.

If you've gone through the [getting started guide](/llamaindex/quickstart) **you already have a agentic chat UI setup**! Nothing else is needed
to get started.

## When should I use this?

CopilotKit provides a variety of different batteries-included components to choose from to create agent native applications. They scale
from simple chat UIs to completely custom applications.
