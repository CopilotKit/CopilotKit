# Copilot Infrastructure for LlamaIndex Agents

Full user-interaction infrastructure for your agents, to turn your agents into Copilot Agents (CoAgents).


## Building blocks of a CoAgent

Everything you need to build Agent-Native Applications (ANAs), right out of the box.

## Common Questions

Have a question about CoAgents? You're in the right place!

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Can you explain what a CoAgent is in more detail?">
Sure! CoAgents are what we call "agentic copilots". Well, what's an agentic copilot then?

Think of a Copilot as a simple and fully LLM controlled assistant that has relatively limited capabilities. An Agentic Copilot then is a copilot
that has been enhanced with the ability to use LlamaIndex agents to perform more complex tasks. This is an extremely powerful way to build AI
powered applications because it gives you, the developer, the ability to control the agent's behavior in a deterministic way while still letting
the agent do its magic.

For more on this topic, checkout our [agentic copilot](/llamaindex/concepts/agentic-copilots) concept page.
