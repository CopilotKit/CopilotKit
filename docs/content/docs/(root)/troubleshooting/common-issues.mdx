## I am getting network errors / API not found error

If you're encountering network or API errors, here's how to troubleshoot:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Check your endpoint configuration">
        Verify your endpoint configuration in your CopilotKit setup:

        ```tsx
        <CopilotKit
          runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
        >
          {/* Your app */}
        </CopilotKit>
        ```

        or, if using CopilotCloud
        ```tsx
        <CopilotKit
            publicApiKey="<your-copilot-cloud-public-api-key>"
        >
            {/* Your app */}
        </CopilotKit>
        ```

        Common issues:
        - Missing leading slash in endpoint path
        - Incorrect path relative to your app's base URL, or, if using absolute paths, incorrect full URL
        - Typos in the endpoint path
        - If using CopilotCloud, make sure to omit the `runtimeUrl` property and provide a valid API key
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="localhost vs 127.0.0.1">
        If you're running locally and getting connection errors, try using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`:

        ```bash
        # If this doesn't work:
        http://localhost:3000/api/copilotkit

        # Try this instead:
        http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/copilotkit
        ```

        This is often due to local DNS resolution issues in `/etc/hosts` or network configuration.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Verify your backend is running">
        Make sure your backend server is:
        - Running on the expected port
        - Accessible from your frontend
        - Not blocked by CORS or firewalls

        Check the [quickstart](/quickstart) to see how to set it up
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## I am getting "CopilotKit's Remote Endpoint" not found error

If you're getting a "CopilotKit's Remote Endpoint not found" error, it usually means the server serving `/info` endpoint isn't accessible. Here's how to fix it:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Check your FastAPI setup (if using pytho's FastAPI)">
        Make sure your FastAPI app has the CopilotKitSDK properly set up.<br/>
        Refer to [Remote Python Endpoint](/guides/backend-actions/remote-backend-endpoint) to see how to set it up
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Test your endpoint">
        The `/info` endpoint should return agent or action information. Test it directly:

        ```bash
        curl -v -d '{}' http://localhost:8000/copilotkit/info
        ```
        The response looks something like this:
        ```bash
        * Host localhost:8000 was resolved.
        * IPv6: ::1
        * IPv4: 127.0.0.1
        *   Trying [::1]:8000...
        * connect to ::1 port 8000 from ::1 port 55049 failed: Connection refused
        *   Trying 127.0.0.1:8000...
        * Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8000
        > POST /copilotkit/info HTTP/1.1
        > Host: localhost:8000
        > User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
        > Accept: */*
        > Content-Length: 2
        > Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        >
        * upload completely sent off: 2 bytes
        < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        < date: Thu, 16 Jan 2025 17:45:05 GMT
        < server: uvicorn
        < content-length: 214
        < content-type: application/json
        <
        * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
        {"actions":[],"agents":[{"name":"my_agent","description":"A helpful agent.","type":"langgraph"},],"sdkVersion":"0.1.32"}%
        ```

        As you can see, it's a JSON response with your registered agents and actions, as well as the `200 OK` HTTP response status.
        If you see a different response, check your FastAPI logs for errors.
