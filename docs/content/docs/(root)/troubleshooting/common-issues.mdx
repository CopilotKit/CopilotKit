## I am getting network errors / API not found error

If you're encountering network or API errors, here's how to troubleshoot:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Check your endpoint configuration">
        Verify your endpoint configuration in your CopilotKit setup:

        ```tsx
        <CopilotKit
          runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
        >
          {/* Your app */}
        </CopilotKit>
        ```

        or, if using CopilotCloud
        ```tsx
        <CopilotKit
            publicApiKey="<your-copilot-cloud-public-api-key>"
        >
            {/* Your app */}
        </CopilotKit>
        ```

        Common issues:
        - Missing leading slash in endpoint path
        - Incorrect path relative to your app's base URL, or, if using absolute paths, incorrect full URL
        - Typos in the endpoint path
        - If using CopilotCloud, make sure to omit the `runtimeUrl` property and provide a valid API key
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="localhost vs 127.0.0.1">
        If you're running locally and getting connection errors, try using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`:

        ```bash
        # If this doesn't work:
        http://localhost:3000/api/copilotkit

        # Try this instead:
        http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/copilotkit
        ```

        This is often due to local DNS resolution issues in `/etc/hosts` or network configuration.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Verify your backend is running">
        Make sure your backend server is:
        - Running on the expected port
        - Accessible from your frontend
        - Not blocked by CORS or firewalls
        
        Try accessing the endpoint directly in your browser or with curl:
        ```bash
        curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/copilotkit
        ```
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## I am getting "CopilotKit's Remote Endpoint" not found error

If you're getting a "CopilotKit's Remote Endpoint not found" error, it usually means the server serving `/info` endpoint isn't accessible. Here's how to fix it:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Check your FastAPI setup (if using pytho's FastAPI)">
        Make sure your FastAPI app has the CopilotKitSDK properly set up.<br/>
        Refer to [Remote Python Endpoint](/guides/backend-actions/remote-backend-endpoint) to see how to set it up
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Test your endpoint">
        The `/info` endpoint should return agent or action information. Test it directly:

        ```bash
        curl -v -X POST -d '{}' http://localhost:8000/copilotkit/info
        ```

        You should see a JSON response with your registered agents and actions. If not, check your FastAPI logs for errors.
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>
