## What's changed?

### New Look and Feel

CopilotKit 1.8.0 introduces a new default look and feel. This includes new theming variables, new components, and generally a fresh look.

<ImageAndCode
    id="new-look-and-feel"
    preview={<NewLookAndFeelPreview />}
>

```tsx
"use client"

import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

export const NewLookAndFeelPreview = () => {

    const chatStyles = "h-96 rounded-lg "
    return (
        <CopilotKit publicApiKey="ck_pub_ff8920cf96bfa51923dc4c4d2d56ef11">
            <CopilotChat
                className={chatStyles}
                onThumbsUp={(message) => {alert(message)}} 
                onThumbsDown={(message) => {alert(message)}}     
            />
        </CopilotKit>
    )
}
```
</ImageAndCode>

### Thumbs Up/Down Handlers

The `ThumbsUpDown` component now has handlers for when the user clicks on the thumbs up or down buttons. This allows you to take action when the user votes.

```tsx
<CopilotChat 
    onThumbsUp={(message) => {console.log(message)}} 
    onThumbsDown={(message) => {console.log(message)}}     
/>
```
This was previously achievable in our framework, but we're making it first class now! You can use this to help fine-tune your model through CopilotKit
or just generally track user feedback.

### New CSS variables

CopilotKit 1.8.0 introduces new CSS variables for the theme. These can be used to customize the look and feel of the CopilotKit. There are 3 new variables:

- `--copilot-kit-text-light-color`: The color of the light text in the chat.
- `--copilot-kit-text-dark-color`: The color of the dark text in the chat.
- `--copilot-kit-header-color`: The background color of the header of the chat window.

These variables can be used to customize the colors of the CopilotKit.

Some other variables have been repurposed to be more inline with what their name describes:
