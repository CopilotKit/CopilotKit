The agentic ecosystem is rapidly organizing around a family of open, complementary protocols — each addressing a distinct layer of interaction.

CopilotKit can connect your application to backend agents directly via **AG-UI**, **MCP**, and **A2A**.

        An open protocol led by CopilotKit and several agent framework companies. It serves as the <strong>general-purpose, bi-directional connection</strong> between a user-facing application and any agentic backend.<br/><br/>You can think of AG-UI as the <strong>"kitchen sink" protocol</strong> — informed by bottom-up, real-world needs for building best-in-class agentic applications.

## **Mixing and Matching Protocols**

CopilotKit lets developers connect to any of these protocols **directly or in combination.**
CopilotKit can connect through any of the Interaction Protocols to your agentic backend.

Or, since AG-UI also includes **handshakes** with both **MCP** and **A2A**, CopilotKit can connect to MCP or A2A supporting agents through AG-UI.

This means that if your host agent connects to subagents using **MCP** or **A2A**, their UI properties can be propagated all the way through to the user-facing application — while preserving **full security, policy, and observability controls.**
