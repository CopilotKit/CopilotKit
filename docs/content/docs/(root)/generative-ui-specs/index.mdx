## **Generative UI Specifications**

Several recently released specifications enable agents to return generative UI, increasing the power and flexibility of the Agent-to-User conversation.

**A2UI**, **MCP-UI**, and **Open-JSON-UI** are all generative UI specifications that allow agents to respond to users not only with text but also with dynamic UI components.

| **Specification** | **Origin / Maintainer** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A2UI** | Google | A declarative, LLM-friendly Generative UI spec. JSONL-based and streaming, designed for platform-agnostic rendering. |
| **Open-JSON-UI** | OpenAI | An open standardization of OpenAI's internal declarative Generative UI schema. |
| **MCP-UI** | Microsoft + Shopify | A fully open, iframe-based Generative UI standard extending MCP for user-facing experiences. |

## **AG-UI vs Generative UI Specs**

Despite the naming similarities, **AG-UI is not a generative UI specification** — it's a **User Interaction protocol** that provides the **bi-directional runtime connection** between the agent and the application.

AG-UI natively supports all of the above generative UI specs and allows developers to define **their own custom generative UI standards** as well.
