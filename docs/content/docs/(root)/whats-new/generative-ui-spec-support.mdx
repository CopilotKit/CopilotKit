# Universal Generative UI Spec Support

CopilotKit now provides **universal support for all major Generative UI specifications**, enabling agents to generate dynamic user interfaces using any of the leading industry standards.

## Supported Specifications

CopilotKit's AG-UI protocol natively supports all three major generative UI specs:

### **A2UI** - Google's Declarative Spec
Google's declarative, LLM-friendly Generative UI specification that uses JSONL format for streaming and platform-agnostic rendering.

- ✅ JSONL-based streaming support
- ✅ Declarative component definitions
- ✅ Platform-agnostic rendering
- ✅ Optimized for LLM generation

### **Open-JSON-UI** - OpenAI's Standard
OpenAI's open standardization of their internal declarative Generative UI schema, providing structured, type-safe component definitions.

- ✅ JSON-based component model
- ✅ Strong type safety
- ✅ OpenAI ecosystem integration
- ✅ Standardized structure

### **MCP-UI** - Microsoft + Shopify's Iframe-Based Spec
A fully open, iframe-based Generative UI standard extending the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for rich, interactive experiences.

- ✅ Full HTML/CSS/JavaScript support
- ✅ Iframe-based sandboxing
- ✅ Native MCP integration
- ✅ Security-first architecture

## Why Multiple Specs?

Different generative UI specifications excel in different scenarios:

- **A2UI** is ideal for streaming, real-time UI generation
- **Open-JSON-UI** provides strong typing and OpenAI integration
- **MCP-UI** enables rich, interactive experiences with full web capabilities

CopilotKit's universal support means you can choose the right specification for your use case—or even use multiple specs within the same application.

## AG-UI: The Universal Protocol

CopilotKit's **AG-UI protocol** acts as the universal runtime that supports all these specifications. AG-UI provides:

- **Bi-directional communication** between agents and applications
- **Multi-spec support** for any generative UI standard
- **Custom spec support** for your own proprietary formats
- **Streaming capabilities** for real-time UI updates

## Getting Started

To use generative UI specs with CopilotKit:

1. **Choose your spec** - Select A2UI, Open-JSON-UI, or MCP-UI based on your needs
2. **Configure your agent** - Set up your agent to return UI specifications
3. **Integrate AG-UI** - Use CopilotKit's AG-UI protocol to handle rendering
4. **Customize rendering** - Implement custom renderers for your components

```typescript
// Example: Agent returns generative UI
{
  type: "a2ui", // or "open-json-ui" or "mcp-ui"
  spec: {
    // Your UI specification
  }
}
```
