| [**useAgent**](#useagent) | Superset of useCoAgent with more control, including: Shared State, Time Travel, Multi-Agent Execution and Agent Mutual Awareness |
| [**Threads and Persistence**](#threads--persistence) | Multiple, long running and resumable, agent conversations |
| [**New Design System**](#new-design-system) | Deeper UX customization |
| [**Direct to LLM** **Improvements**](#direct-to-llm-improvements) | Shared state & Additional supported LLMs |
| [**Zod schema support**](#zod-schema-support) | Type safe compilation and runtime |
| [**Simplified Infrastructure**](#simplified-infrastructure) | Removal of GraphQL |
| [**Backwards Compatibility**](#backwards-compatibility) | All CopilotKit v 1.10 compatible apps can be updated to v 1.50 with no required coding changes |

# Backwards Compatibility

Everything you’re already using continues to work.  v1.50 is fully backwards compatible with client code using v1.10.  In fact, as a first step in this pre-release period, we would love for you to start with just rebuilding, and let us know if you run into any problems.

### V2 interfaces

As we said above, all of the v1 (or unversioned) hooks continue to work with v1.50.  To take advantage of new hooks you’ll use those marked as /v2 (shown below).

You can opt into any of the new developer interfaces or keep using the old ones. Mixing is allowed in the following configurations:

- New Chat component + old hooks
- Old components + new hooks
- New v2 APIs are exposed under a subpath:
    
    ```tsx
    import { CopilotChat, useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    ```
    
---

# `useAgent`

The v2 hook useAgent is a proper superset of `useCoAgent` which gives more control over the agent connection, including:

### Shared state
    
    ```tsx
    import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    
    const { agent } = useAgent({ agentId: "my-agent" });
    
    agent.state
    agent.setState
    ```
    
### Time travel
    
    ```tsx
    import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    
    const { agent } = useAgent({ agentId: "my-agent" });
    
    agent.setMessages()
    ```
    
### Multi-agent execution
    
    ```tsx
    import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    
    const { agent: langgraph } = useAgent({ agentId: "langgraph" });
    const { agent: pydantic } = useAgent({ agentId: "pydantic" });
    
    [langgraph, pydantic].forEach((agent) => {
      agent.addMessage({ id: crypto.randomUUID(), role: "user", content: message });
      agent.runAgent();
    });
    ```
    
### Agent Mutual Awareness

You can even make agents aware of each other!
    
    ```tsx
    import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
    
    const { agent: langgraph } = useAgent({ agentId: "langgraph" });
    const { agent: pydantic } = useAgent({ agentId: "pydantic" });
    
    langgraph.setMessages(pydantic.messages)
    pydantic.setMessages(langgraph.messages)
    ```
    

---
## Coming Soon
v1.50 is available now, with useAgent fully ready.  The other features (listed below) will be added as they come out in the near future.  

### Threads & Persistence

v1.50 delivers support for threaded conversations, with built in thread storage and connection components.  Support for development with InMemory or SQLite is provided out of the box.

#### Thread storage
    - **For development:** `InMemory` or `SQLite` out of the box
        
        ```tsx
        import { CopilotRuntime } from "@copilotkit/runtime";
        
        const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
          agents: {
            default: agent,
          },
          runner: new InMemoryAgentRunner(), // new abstraction for persistence
        });
        ```
        
    - **For production**
        - **Coming soon! -** Use **Copilot Cloud** (managed) or **Copilot Enterprise** (self hosted) to persist threads to your own databases, get automatic stream reconnection, in-built product analytics.
            - **👉 Join the [Enterprise Early Access](https://go.copilotkit.ai/enterprise-threads-waitlist) waitlist!**
        
#### Thread connection
    - Loading a thread
        
        ```tsx
        import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2"
        
        <CopilotChat threadId="xyz" /> // connects to runtime's runner
        ```
        
    - Stream reconnection
        
        ```tsx
        import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2"
        
        <CopilotChat threadId="xyz" /> // will reconnect if page is reloaded
        ```
        

---

### New Design System

You can continue to use the design system in the v1 interfaces, but v2 provides A full UI overhaul with deeper customization:

- New `CopilotChat`, `CopilotSidebar`, `CopilotPopup`
    - Just an import away at `@copilotkit/react-core/v2`
    - New slot system for flexible overrides
    - Much better out-of-the-box markdown rendering
- Suggestions API that works cleanly with agents

---

### Zod Schema Support

Many CopilotKit hooks now take Zod schemas, enforcing type safety at both compile and run time.

- `useHumanInTheLoop` - now takes Zod schemas
- `useFrontendTool` - now takes Zod schemas
- `useRenderToolCall` - new dev-experience principles

---

### Simplified Infrastructure

Earlier versions of CopilotKit required GraphQL installation.  That is completely removed by the new architecture.

---

### Direct to LLM Improvements

Our direct to LLM integration now supports more models and implements shared state.

#### BasicAgent - Now with broader model support

```tsx
import { BasicAgent } from "@copilotkit/runtime"

const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  agents: {
    myBasicAgent: new BasicAgent({
		  model: "openai/gpt-4o", // much broader model support
		  prompt: "You are a helpful AI assistant.",
		  temperature: 0.7,
		});
  },
});
```

#### Shared state support

```tsx
import { useAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

const { agent } = useAgent({agentId: "myBasicAgent"});  
const { state, setState } = agent;
```
