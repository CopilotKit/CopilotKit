## What are Deep Agents?

They go beyond basic agents. They can plan multi-step workflows, manage their own file systems for context, spawn subagents for specialized tasks, and maintain long-term memory across sessions.

## Deep Agents in Your App Through CopilotKit

CopilotKit brings your Deep Agents to the frontend. Users can see the agent's thought process, interact with subagents as they spawn, and collaborate with the agent in real-time. It bridges the gap between powerful backend agents and actual user experience.
