## [Generative UI Spec Support](/whats-new/generative-ui-spec-support) with zero day support for A2UI
CopilotKit now supports all major Generative UI specifications - A2UI, Open-JSON-UI, and MCP-UI.

CopilotKit has been working with Google on A2A and A2UI integrations, and is proud to be a launch partner for A2UI.

Check out the [A2UI composer](https://a2ui-editor.ag-ui.com/) (written by CopilotKit engineers), which you can use to create or find widgets to use in the CopilotKit [A2A integration](./a2a).  See the sample app here!

## [CopilotKit v1.50](/whats-new/v1-50)
CopilotKit v1.50 is now available, with brand new interfaces, streamlined internals, and no breaking changes.

## [A2A and MCP Handshake](/whats-new/a2a-mcp-handshake)
AG-UI now includes handshakes with both A2A and MCP protocols, enabling seamless interoperability across the full agentic stack.
