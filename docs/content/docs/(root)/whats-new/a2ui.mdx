# A2UI - Google's Generative UI Spec

CopilotKit now supports **A2UI**, Google's declarative, LLM-friendly Generative UI specification.

## What is A2UI?

A2UI is a declarative generative UI specification created by Google. It's designed to be:

- **JSONL-based** - Uses JSON Lines format for streaming
- **LLM-friendly** - Easy for language models to generate
- **Platform-agnostic** - Can be rendered on any platform
- **Streaming-first** - Built for real-time, progressive rendering

## Why A2UI?

### Declarative Approach
A2UI allows agents to describe UI components declaratively, making it easier for LLMs to generate dynamic interfaces without needing to understand implementation details.

### Streaming Support
Built with streaming in mind, A2UI enables progressive rendering as the agent generates responses, providing a better user experience.

### Platform Agnostic
A2UI specifications can be rendered on web, mobile, or any other platform, making your agent's UI truly universal.

## Using A2UI with CopilotKit

CopilotKit's AG-UI protocol natively supports A2UI alongside other generative UI specifications like MCP-UI and Open-JSON-UI.

```typescript
// Example: Agent returns A2UI specification
{
  type: "a2ui",
  spec: {
    // A2UI JSONL specification
  }
}
```
