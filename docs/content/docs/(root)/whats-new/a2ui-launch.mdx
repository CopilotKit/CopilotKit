## A2UI Launch Day — Full Compatibility

CopilotKit has been working closely with Google on A2A and A2UI integrations, and is proud to be a **launch partner for A2UI**.

### What is A2UI?

A2UI (Agent-to-UI) is Google's declarative, LLM-friendly generative UI specification. It defines *what* to render and how to structure agent responses visually — enabling agents to produce rich, interactive UI components that can be rendered across different platforms and frameworks.

CopilotKit provides **zero-day support** for A2UI, meaning you can start using A2UI widgets in your CopilotKit-powered applications immediately.

### A2UI Composer

Check out the [A2UI Composer](https://a2ui-editor.ag-ui.com/) (built by CopilotKit engineers), which you can use to:

- **Create** custom A2UI widgets visually
- **Browse** and find existing widgets
- **Test** widgets before integrating them into your app

### Sample App

See the [sample app](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/examples/a2a) to see A2UI in action with CopilotKit!
