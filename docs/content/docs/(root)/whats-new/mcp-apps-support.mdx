## CopilotKit: Your App + MCP Apps

CopilotKit and AG-UI bring MCP apps into your application — where you control UX, permissions, workflows, and agent behavior — instead of confining them to first-party AI chat experiences.

Using MCP Apps through CopilotKit lets your app move beyond text-only copilots and become an interactive, agent-driven product where tools can ask users for input, confirmation, and decisions at the exact moment they matter.
