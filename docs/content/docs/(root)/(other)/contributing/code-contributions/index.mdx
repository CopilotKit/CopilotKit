title: Code Contributions

We are grateful for your interest in contributing to CopilotKit. We welcome new contributors and appreciate your help in making CopilotKit better.

This guide will help you get started as smoothly as possible.

## Step 1: Install Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 20.x or later
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v9.x installed globally (`npm i -g pnpm@^9`)
- [Turborepo v2.x](https://turborepo.org/) installed globally (`npm i -g turbo@2`)

## Step 2: Repository Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
  ### Fork The Repository
  First, head over to the [CopilotKit repository](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit) and create a fork.

  Then, clone your fork to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CopilotKit
  cd CopilotKit/CopilotKit
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Install Dependencies
  <Callout type="info">
    The CopilotKit repository is a monorepo based on [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/).
    We use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as our package manager.
  </Callout>

  Install the dependencies using pnpm:
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### Build Packages
  To make sure everything works, let's build all packages once:
  ```bash
  turbo run build
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Development Mode
Now that everything is set up and works as expected, you can get start developing:

```bash
# Start all packages in development mode
turbo run dev

# Start a specific package in development mode
turbo run dev --filter="@copilotkit/package-name"
```

Now you can start making changes to the code.

<Callout type="info">
You can find all `@copilotkit/*` packages under the `packages` folder of the monorepo.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Test Changes in Real-Time

In most cases, you want to seamlessly be able to test your changes in real-time as you develop.

We have an `examples` folder in the monorepo with a few different examples using CopilotKit. You can run these examples to test your changes, as they are linked to the `@copilotkit/*` packages in the monorepo.

For this tutorial, we'll use the `next-openai` example, specifically the Presentation Demo (`/presentation`).

In a separate terminal, run the following command to start the example:

```bash
cd examples/next-openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
pnpm run example-dev
```

<Callout type="info">
We use the `pnpm run example-dev` command to run examples, which is different from the `turbo run dev` command we use to work on the individual packages.
</Callout>

Now navigate to http://localhost:3000/presentation and you should see the example running. Any changes you make to the CopilotKit packages will immediately be reflected here.

## Step 5: Formatting and Linting

Before committing your changes, ensure your files are formatted properly by running the following at the root of the monorepo:
```bash
turbo run format
```

Additionally, ensure you have no linting errors:
```bash
turbo run lint
```

## Step 6: Submit a Pull Request

Now that you've made your changes, commit and push them. Then, simply head over to the [Pull Requests page](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/pulls) and create a pull request. Well done!

## Debugging

Every time you run CopilotKit on localhost, you will be able to see the **CopilotKit Dev Console** in the chat window. The Dev Console provides you with useful functionality to debug your copilot (e.g. see what state the copilot is aware of, actions it can perform, etc).

<Frame description="CopilotKit Dev Console">
  <img
    src="/images/contributing/copilotkit-dev-console.png"
    className="w-auto max-w-[420px]"
  />
</Frame>

If you'd like to disable the Dev Console locally, simply set `showDevConsole` to `false` in your `<CopilotKit />` provider.

## (Advanced) Package Linking

 In some cases, you want to test your CopilotKit changes in your own project. For example, you tried to integrate CopilotKit into your own codebase and encountered a bug you want to fix.

 Conveniently, you can link your local CopilotKit packages to your own project to test your changes.

 Check out the [Advanced: Package Linking](/contributing/code-contributions/package-linking) guide to learn how to do that.
