## What is shared state?

Agentic Copilots maintain a shared state that seamlessly connects your UI with the agent's execution. This shared state system allows you to:

- Display the agent's current progress and intermediate results
- Update the agent's state through UI interactions
- React to state changes in real-time across your application

<Callout title="Ready to Implement Shared State?">
Shared State can be implemented with many supported Agent Frameworks, with each framework providing different approaches for creating bidirectional data flow between your application and AI agents.

**Choose your integration to see framework-specific implementation guides and examples.**

## When should I use this?

Shared state is perfect when you want to facilitate collaboration between your agent and the user. Updates to the outputs will be automatically shared by the UI. Similarly, any `inputs` that the user updates in the UI will be automatically reflected in the crews execution.

This allows for a consistent experience where both the agent and the user are on the same page.
