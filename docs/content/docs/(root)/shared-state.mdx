## What is Shared State?

Shared State is a bidirectional data synchronization system that allows your application and AI agents to share information in real-time. It creates a unified data layer where both your frontend application and AI agents can read from and write to the same state, enabling seamless collaboration and context awareness.

This shared context allows agents to understand your application's current state and make more informed decisions, while your application can react to agent state changes in real-time.

## Why Use Shared State?

Shared State creates a foundation for intelligent, context-aware AI interactions:

### **Context Awareness**
Agents have access to your application's current state, enabling them to provide more relevant and contextual responses and actions.

### **Real-time Synchronization**
Changes made by agents are immediately reflected in your application, and vice versa, creating a seamless collaborative experience.

### **Persistent Memory**
Agents can remember information across interactions, building up context and understanding over time.

### **Collaborative Workflows**
Users and agents can work together on the same data, with each party's changes visible to the other in real-time.

### **Enhanced User Experience**
Applications can provide immediate visual feedback as agents process information and update their internal state.

## Common Shared State Patterns

### **Application State Sharing**
Your application shares its current state with agents, allowing them to understand context like current user, selected items, or active workflows.

### **Agent State Visualization**
Agents share their internal state with your application, enabling you to show users what the agent is thinking or working on.

### **Collaborative Data Editing**
Both users and agents can modify the same data structures, with changes synchronized in real-time.

### **Progress Tracking**
Agents share their progress on long-running tasks, allowing applications to show real-time status updates.

### **Context Preservation**
State persists across agent interactions, maintaining context and continuity in conversations.

## Types of Shared State

### **Read-only State**
Application state that agents can read but not modify, useful for providing context without allowing agent modifications.

### **Write-only State**
State that agents can update but applications only consume, common for agent outputs and results.

### **Bidirectional State**
State that both applications and agents can read and write, enabling true collaborative editing and interaction.

### **Ephemeral State**
State that exists only during active sessions, useful for temporary context and working data.

### **Persistent State**
State that survives across sessions, enabling agents to build long-term memory and context.

## When to Use Shared State

Consider Shared State when you need:

- **Context-aware agents** that understand your application's current state
- **Real-time collaboration** between users and agents
- **Visual feedback** showing agent progress and thinking
- **Persistent memory** across agent interactions
- **Seamless data flow** between application and agent workflows
- **Collaborative editing** where both parties modify the same data
- **Enhanced user experience** with immediate visual updates

## Implementation Considerations

### **Data Synchronization**
- Ensure consistent data formats between application and agent state
- Handle conflicts when both parties modify the same data simultaneously
- Implement efficient update mechanisms to avoid performance issues

### **State Management**
- Design clear boundaries for what state should be shared vs. private
- Consider state size and complexity to avoid overwhelming agents or applications
- Implement proper state validation and error handling

### **Performance**
- Optimize state synchronization to minimize latency
- Consider batching updates for frequently changing state
- Implement efficient diffing algorithms for large state objects

### **Security and Privacy**
- Carefully control what application state is exposed to agents
- Implement proper access controls for sensitive state information
- Consider data privacy implications of persistent state storage
