## What's next?

For next steps, here are some ideas:

- Add suggestions to your copilot, using the [`useCopilotChatSuggestions`](/reference/hooks/useCopilotChatSuggestions) hook.
- Add an initial assistatnt message to your chat window (for more info, check the documentation for [`<CopilotPopup />`](/reference/components/chat/CopilotPopup)).
- Dive deeper into the useful [`useCopilotChat`](/reference/hooks/useCopilotChat) hook, which enables you to set the system message, append messages, and more.
- Implement autocompletion using the [`<CopilotTextarea />`](/reference/components/CopilotTextarea) component.
- Follow the [Textarea Autocomplete tutorial](/tutorials/ai-powered-textarea/overview) to learn more about CopilotKit.

We have more tutorials coming soon.
