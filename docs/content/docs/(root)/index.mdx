# What is CopilotKit?

At its core, CopilotKit is a set of tools that make it easy to **let your users work
alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) to accomplish generative tasks** directly in
your application. Instead of just using the LLM to generate content, you can let it
take direct action alongside your users.
