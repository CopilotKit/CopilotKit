# Production-Grade AI Copilots. <br/> Built Fast, Customized Effortlessly.

CopilotKit is your secret weapon for shipping production-ready AI copilots.

Whether you need a simple chatbot or a complex multi-agent system, we've got you
covered with powerful agentic integrations, human-in-the-loop infrastructure, and
a flexible architecture.

## Choose Your Path.

You can use CopilotKit in two modes: **Standard** and **CoAgents**.

## Common Questions
We've got answers to some common questions!

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What is a Copilot?">
    A Copilot is a trusted partner that lives in your application to help your users get things done.
    There are two main types, the **Concierge** and the **Worker**.

    ### Concierge

    The Concierge Copilot understands your application's capabilities and full user context. It translates 
    high-level user intent into actions by serving as an intelligent intermediary.

    For example, our [Banking Assistant](https://github.com/CopilotKit/demo-banking) implements Concierge Copilots 
    to help users manage their (_fake_) banking needs.
    

    ### Worker

    The Worker Copilot is a domain-specific agent that can help users perform their core work tasks.
    It serves as a partner to the user that is better at performing some tasks and worse at others. 
    Ultimtately, it amplifies your users to produce better work than they thought possible. This pattern
    is often used in backoffice copilots.

    Think of the Worker Copilot as Cursor, Replit Agent, or Windsurf, but for any domain. For example, 
    see our [Open Researcher ANA](https://github.com/CopilotKit/open-research-ana).

  <Accordion title="How does it all work?">
    Great question! CopilotKit has three main components:
    1. **CopilotKit UI**: The UI components that you use to build your Copilots and Agents.
    2. **CopilotKit Runtime**: The runtime that you use to build your Copilots and Agents. This serves as the backend for your Copilots and Agents.
    3. **CopilotKit SDK**: In more complex applications, you'll use the SDK to deeply integrate CopilotKit into your agents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use any LLM with CopilotKit?">
    Yes! CopilotKit supports most LLMs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more. In addition, you can use any LLM that is supported by LangGraph or
