<h2 className="mt-0">Get Started!</h2>
If you have a **NextJS** application, you can use our CLI to automatically bootstrap your application for use with CopilotKit.

```bash
npx copilotkit@latest init
```

  <Accordion title="Starting from scratch?">
    No problem! Just use `create-next-app` to make a new NextJS application quickly.
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest

<h2 className="mt-0">What is CopilotKit?</h2>
CopilotKit is the easiest way to add AI copilots - intelligent, context-aware assistants - into your app.

CopilotKit connects your app's **logic, state, and user context** to the **AI agents** that deliver the animated and interactive part of your app experience â€” across both embedded UIs and fully headless interfaces. It gives you the tools to build, deploy, and monitor AI-assisted features that feel intuitive, helpful, and deeply integrated.

By decoupling your application from any specific model or agent architecture, CopilotKit gives you the freedom to evolve your AI stack without rethinking your user experience.

## Common Questions
We've got answers to some common questions!

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What is a Copilot?">
    A Copilot is a trusted partner that lives in your application to help your users get things done.
    There are two main types, the **Concierge** and the **Worker**.

    ### Concierge

    The Concierge Copilot understands your application's capabilities and full user context. It translates 
    high-level user intent into actions by serving as an intelligent intermediary.

    For example, our [Banking Assistant](https://github.com/CopilotKit/demo-banking) implements Concierge Copilots 
    to help users manage their (_fake_) banking needs.
    

    ### Worker

    The Worker Copilot is a domain-specific agent that can help users perform their core work tasks.
    It serves as a partner to the user that is better at performing some tasks and worse at others. 
    Ultimately, it amplifies your users to produce better work than they thought possible. This pattern
    is often used in backoffice copilots.

    Think of the Worker Copilot as Cursor, Replit Agent, or Windsurf, but for any domain. For example, 
    see our [Open Researcher ANA](https://github.com/CopilotKit/open-research-ana).

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does it all work?">
    Great question! CopilotKit has three main components:
    1. **CopilotKit UI**: The UI components that you use to build your Copilots and Agents.
    2. **CopilotKit Runtime**: The runtime that you use to build your Copilots and Agents. This serves as the backend for your Copilots and Agents.
    3. **CopilotKit SDK**: In more complex applications, you'll use the SDK to deeply integrate CopilotKit into your agents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use any LLM with CopilotKit?">
    Yes! CopilotKit supports most LLMs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more. In addition, you can use any LLM that is supported by LangGraph or
    LangChain.

    For more information, checkout our documentation on [bringing your own LLM](/guides/bring-your-own-llm).
