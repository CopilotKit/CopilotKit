  <Accordion title="How does it all work?">
    Great question! CopilotKit has three main components:
    1. **CopilotKit UI**: The UI components that you use to build your Copilots and Agents.
    2. **CopilotKit Runtime**: The runtime that you use to build your Copilots and Agents. This serves as the backend for your Copilots and Agents.
    3. **CopilotKit SDK**: In more complex applications, you'll use the SDK to deeply integrate CopilotKit into your agents.
