      CopilotKit is the easiest way to add AI copilots - intelligent, context-aware assistants - into your app.

      CopilotKit connects your app's **logic, state, and user context** to the **AI agents** that deliver the animated and interactive part of your app experience — across both embedded UIs and fully headless interfaces. It gives you the tools to build, deploy, and monitor AI-assisted features that feel intuitive, helpful, and deeply integrated.

      By decoupling your application from any specific model or agent architecture, CopilotKit gives you the freedom to evolve your AI stack without rethinking your user experience.
