## Backend Readable State
CopilotKit allows you to define actions on the backend that can be called by your Copilot. Behind the scenes, this is securely binding
the action as a tool to your LLM of choice. 

When you ask the LLM decides to retrieve the data, it will do so by securely calling the backend action.

  For more information about backend actions, see the [Backend Action](/docs/guides/backend-actions) guides.

```tsx title="/api/copilotkit/route.ts"
const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  actions: ({properties, url}) => {
    // You can use the input parameters to the actions generator to expose different backend actions to the Copilot at different times: 
    // `url` is the current URL on the frontend application.
    // `properties` contains custom properties you can pass from the frontend application.
    
    return [
      {
        name: "fetchNameForUserId",
        description: "Fetches user name from the database for a given ID.",
        parameters: [
          {
            name: "userId",
            type: "string",
            description: "The ID of the user to fetch data for.",
            required: true,
          },
        ],
        handler: async ({userId}: {userId: string}) => {
          // do something with the userId
          // return the user data
          const simulateDatabaseCall = async (userId: string) => { return { name: "Darth Doe" } }
          return await simulateDatabaseCall(userId)
