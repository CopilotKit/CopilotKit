export function MyComponent() {
  // [!code highlight:9]
  useCopilotChatSuggestions(
    {
      instructions: "Suggest the most relevant next actions.",
      minSuggestions: 1,
      maxSuggestions: 2,
    },
    [relevantState],
  );
}

import { useCopilotChatSuggestions } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
 
export function MyComponent() {
  useCopilotChatSuggestions(
    {
      instructions: "Suggest the most relevant next actions.",
      minSuggestions: 1,
      maxSuggestions: 2,
    },
    [relevantState], // [!code highlight]
