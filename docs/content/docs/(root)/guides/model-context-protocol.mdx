## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard that allows AI models to discover and use tools from external servers. By integrating MCP support, CopilotKit can connect to these servers and leverage their capabilities, expanding what your AI assistant can do.

## Setup MCP with CopilotKit

Setting up MCP with CopilotKit requires both frontend and backend configuration.

### Frontend Setup

Add the `mcpEndpoints` property to your `CopilotKit` component:

```tsx
"use client";

import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";

export default function PageLevelComponent() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit
      runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
      mcpEndpoints={[
        {
          endpoint: "your_mcp_sse_url",
        },
      ]}
    >
      <div className="flex h-screen p-4">
        <CopilotChat
          instructions="You are a helpful assistant that can answer questions about the user's account. You have access to MCP servers if defined in the mcpEndpoints array."
          className="flex-grow rounded-lg w-full"
        />
      </div>
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}
```

### Backend Setup

Configure your backend to handle MCP requests (this example uses Next.js App Router):

```tsx
import {
  CopilotRuntime,
  OpenAIAdapter,
  copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint,
} from "@copilotkit/runtime";
import { experimental_createMCPClient } from "ai";

import { NextRequest } from "next/server";

const serviceAdapter = new OpenAIAdapter();

const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  // @ts-ignore
  createMCPClient: async (config) => {
    return await experimental_createMCPClient({
      transport: {
        type: "sse",
        url: config.endpoint,
        headers: config.apiKey
          ? { Authorization: `Bearer ${config.apiKey}` }
          : undefined,
      },
    });
  },
});

export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
    runtime,
    serviceAdapter,
    endpoint: "/api/copilotkit",
  });

  return handleRequest(req);
};
```

### Environment Setup

Since this example uses `OpenAIAdapter`, you'll need to set up your OpenAI API key in your environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_open_ai_key>
```

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

For production deployments, make sure to set up this environment variable in your hosting platform securely.

## How It Works

Once configured, CopilotKit will:

1. Connect to the specified MCP endpoints
2. Discover available tools from those endpoints
3. Make these tools available to the AI assistant during conversations
4. Automatically route user queries to the appropriate tools when needed

For example, if your MCP server provides a weather tool, users can ask about the weather and the AI will use the MCP tool to fetch and return accurate information.

## Next Steps

- For general CopilotKit setup in different frameworks, refer to the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart)
- Create your own MCP servers to provide custom tools
- Combine MCP tools with [Backend Actions](/guides/backend-actions) for a more powerful AI assistant
