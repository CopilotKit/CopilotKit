### Modify CopilotRuntime to include LangServe integration

Once you've located your `CopilotRuntime`, you can add LangServe integration by returning an array of LangServe function sources in the `langserve` property.

**Note that the input and output types of the chain will be automatically fetched from LangServe -- no need to specify them manually!**

Here's how to implement LangServe integration:

```tsx title="/api/copilotkit/route.ts"
const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  // ... existing configuration
  langserve: [ // [!code highlight:7]
    {
      chainUrl: "http://my-langserve.chain",
      name: "performResearch",
      description: "Performs research on a given topic.",
    },
  ],
});

// ... rest of your route definition
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Test your implementation

After adding the LangServe integration, test it by asking the copilot to perform research on a topic. Observe how it connects to the external LangServe chain and returns the results.
