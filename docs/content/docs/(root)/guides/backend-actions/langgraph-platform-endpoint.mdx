    This guide assumes you've created a LangGraph agent, and have a `langgraph.json` file set up. If you need a quick introduction, check out [this brief example
    from the LangGraph docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) or follow one of our demos.

## Deploy a Graph to LangGraph Platform

<Steps>

    <Step>
    ### Deploy your agent to LangGraph Platform

    To integrate an agent CopilotKit application, it needs to be deployed to the LangGraph Platform.<br/>
    Please follow [the official LangGraph Cloud deployment guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/cloud/).<br /><br />
    A successful deployment would yield a an API URL (often referred here as "deployment URL") in the following format: `https://{project-identifiers}.langgraph.app`. You'll need this later.

    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Connect the app to the remote endpoint
        Now that you've deployed your agent to LangGraph Platform, integrate it into your CopilotKit application by modifying your CopilotRuntime configuration.<br />

        First, find your CopilotRuntime instance in your code.
    </Step>

    <Step>

        Update the `CopilotRuntime` config to include the `remoteEndpoints` property:

        ```tsx
        const runtime: CopilotRuntimeConfig = {
            // ...existing configuration
            remoteEndpoints: [ // [!code highlight:9]
                langGraphCloudEndpoint({
                    deploymentUrl: "your-api-url",
                    langsmithApiKey: "your-langsmith-api-key",
                    // List of all agents which are available under "graphs" list in your langgraph.json file.
                    agents: [{ name: 'my_agent', description: 'A helpful LLM agent' }]
                }),
            ],
        };
        ```

        <Callout type="info">
            Tip: Use the `langGraphCloudEndpoint` type constructor function
        </Callout>

    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Test Your Implementation

        After setting up the remote endpoint and modifying your `CopilotRuntime`, you can test your implementation by asking the copilot to perform actions that invoke your agent.<br/>
        The graph and interactions can viewed in [LangGraph Studio](smith.langchain.com/studio) and any logs should be available on [LangSmith](smith.langchain.com)

    </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

A few things to try if you are running into trouble:

1. Make sure that you listed your agents according to the graphs mentioned in the `langgraph.json` file
2. Make sure the agent names are the same between the agent Python implementation, the `langgraph.json` file and the remote endpoint declaration
3. Make sure the LangGraph Cloud deployment has all environment variables listed as you need them to be, according to your agent implementation
