## Introduction

This quickstart guide shows how to create a simple **Personalized Travel Planner** using AG2 and CopilotKit. In just minutes, you'll build an application that collects user travel preferences and generates custom day-by-day itineraries tailored to their destination, budget, and interests.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

- **Python 3.9** or newer for running the AG2 backend
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download" target="_blank">Node.js</a> 18.18.0 or newer (specifically: ^18.18.0 || ^19.8.0 || >= 20.0.0)
- <a href="https://pnpm.io/installation" target="_blank">pnpm</a> (for package management)
- <a href="https://platform.openai.com/api-keys" target="_blank">OpenAI API key</a>

## Getting started

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Clone the Starter Repository

        <Tabs groupId="language" items={["Python"]}>
            <Tab value="Python">
                ```bash
                git clone https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2-copilotkit-starter.git
                cd ag2-copilotkit-starter
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Set Up the AG2 Backend

        <Callout type="info">
            We recommend using a virtual environment for your project to keep your packages contained. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" target="_blank">venv</a>.
        </Callout>

        #### Install the dependencies and set your `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

        ```bash
        cd agent-py
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

        #### Set up your `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

        ```sh
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
        ```

        #### Launch your AG2 agent:

        ```bash
        uvicorn simple_workflow:app --port 8008 --reload
        ```
        The backend server will start at http://localhost:8008.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Set Up the CopilotKit UI
        
        The last step is to use CopilotKit's UI components to render the chat interaction with your agent.

        In a new terminal:

        ```bash
        cd ui
        pnpm i
        pnpm run dev
        ```

        The frontend application will start at http://localhost:3000.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### ðŸŽ‰ Talk to your agent!

        Congrats! You've successfully integrated a AG2 Agent chatbot to your application. To start, try asking a few questions to your agent.

        ```
        I plan to visit the USA for 4 days on a budget.
        ```

        ```
        I want to plan a trip to Paris for 5 days. I have a mid-range budget and I'm interested in art, history, and food.
        ```

        ```
        I'd like a luxury weekend in New York with focus on Broadway shows and fine dining.
        ```

    </Step>

</Steps>
