To persist AG2 Agent messages to a database, you can use the appropriate persistence methods for your framework. For example, you might use a database connector or provide your own custom persistence class.

For a concrete example of how a custom persistence class like `InMemoryFlowPersistence` can be implemented and used with your framework, see the [sample agent implementation](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/blob/main/examples/coagents-starter-ag2/agent-py/sample_agent/agent.py).

Read more about persistence in the [AG2 Agents documentation](https://docs.ag2.ai/concepts/flows).
