# Image Uploads

CopilotKit supports image uploads in chat interfaces. Users can upload images that will be sent to your AI model.

## Enable Image Uploads

To enable image uploads in your chat interface, simply add the `imageUploadsEnabled` prop to your CopilotKit chat component:

<Tabs defaultValue="sidebar" className="w-full">
  <TabsList className="grid w-full grid-cols-3">
    <TabsTrigger value="sidebar">CopilotSidebar</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="chat">CopilotChat</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="popup">CopilotPopup</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="sidebar">
    ```tsx 
    import {CopilotSidebar} from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
    <CopilotSidebar
      imageUploadsEnabled={true}
      labels={{
        title: "AI Assistant",
        initial: "Hi! You can upload images to chat with me.",
      }}
    >
      {/* Your app content */}
    </CopilotSidebar>
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="chat">
    ```tsx 
    import {CopilotChat} from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
    <CopilotChat
      imageUploadsEnabled={true}
      labels={{
        title: "AI Assistant",
        initial: "Hi! You can upload images to chat with me.",
      }}
    />
    ```
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="popup">
    ```tsx 
    import {CopilotPopup} from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
    <CopilotPopup
      imageUploadsEnabled={true}
      labels={{
        title: "AI Assistant",
        initial: "Hi! You can upload images to chat with me.",
      }}
    />
    ```
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## How It Works

When image uploads are enabled:

1. **Upload Button**: An upload button appears in the chat input area
2. **File Picker**: Users can click to select images from their device
3. **Drag & Drop**: Users can drag images directly into the chat interface
4. **Clipboard Paste**: Users can paste images from their clipboard (Ctrl+V/Cmd+V)
5. **Image Preview**: Selected images appear in a preview queue before sending
6. **Multi-Image Support**: Users can upload multiple images at once

## Customization Options

### File Type Filtering

Control which image formats users can upload:

```tsx
<CopilotChat
  imageUploadsEnabled={true}
  inputFileAccept="image/jpeg,image/png,image/gif" // Only allow specific formats
/>
```

### Default File Types

By default, all image types are accepted (`image/*`).

## Model Compatibility

Image uploads currently work with OpenAI and Anthropic models. Support for other providers may be added in future releases.

## User Experience

### Upload Flow

1. User clicks the upload button or drags images
2. Images appear in a preview queue
3. User can remove images from the queue if needed
4. User types a message (optional) and sends
5. Both text and images are sent to the AI

### Visual Feedback

- Image thumbnails show in the upload queue
- Remove buttons (Ã—) allow users to delete images before sending
- Clear visual distinction between text and image messages in chat history

## Best Practices

- **Inform Users**: Let users know image uploads are available
- **File Formats**: Common formats like PNG, JPEG, and GIF work best
- **Context**: Images work well when combined with descriptive text

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Appearing

- Verify `imageUploadsEnabled={true}` is set
- Ensure image files are valid formats
- Check console for any upload errors

### Upload Button Missing

- Confirm the `imageUploadsEnabled` prop is set to `true`
- Check that you're using a compatible CopilotKit version

### Large Images

- Large images may fail to upload or process
- Consider resizing images before upload if needed
