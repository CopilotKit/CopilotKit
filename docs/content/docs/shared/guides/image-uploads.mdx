## Enable Image Uploads

To enable image uploads in your chat interface, simply add the `imageUploadsEnabled` prop to your CopilotKit chat component:

### CopilotSidebar

```tsx
import { CopilotSidebar } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";

<CopilotSidebar
  imageUploadsEnabled={true}
  labels={{
    title: "AI Assistant",
    initial: "Hi! You can upload images to chat with me.",
  }}
>
  {/* Your app content */}
</CopilotSidebar>;
```

### CopilotChat

```tsx
import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";

<CopilotChat
  imageUploadsEnabled={true}
  labels={{
    title: "AI Assistant",
    initial: "Hi! You can upload images to chat with me.",
  }}
/>;
```

### CopilotPopup

```tsx
import { CopilotPopup } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";

<CopilotPopup
  imageUploadsEnabled={true}
  labels={{
    title: "AI Assistant",
    initial: "Hi! You can upload images to chat with me.",
  }}
/>;
```

## How It Works

When image uploads are enabled:

1. **Upload Button**: An upload button appears in the chat input area
2. **File Picker**: Users can click to select images from their device
3. **Drag & Drop**: Users can drag images directly into the chat interface
4. **Clipboard Paste**: Users can paste images from their clipboard (Ctrl+V/Cmd+V)
5. **Image Preview**: Selected images appear in a preview queue before sending
6. **Multi-Image Support**: Users can upload multiple images at once

## Customization Options

### File Type Filtering

Control which image formats users can upload:

```tsx
<CopilotChat
  imageUploadsEnabled={true}
  inputFileAccept="image/jpeg,image/png,image/gif" // Only allow specific formats
/>
```

### Default File Types

By default, all image types are accepted (`image/*`).

## Model Compatibility

Image uploads currently work with OpenAI and Anthropic models. Support for other providers may be added in future releases.
