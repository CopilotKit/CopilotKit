Until there is full compatibility between Google Gemini and LangChain, you'll need one extra line of configuration in your `server.py` when using Gemini models with Agentic Copilots:

```
sdk = CopilotKitSDK(
    agents=[
        LangGraphAgent(
            name="research_agent",
            description="Research agent.",
            graph=graph,
            copilotkit_config={ # YOU NEED THIS IF YOU USE GOOGLE GEMINI
                "convert_messages": copilotkit_messages_to_langchain(use_function_call=True)
            }
        )
    ],
)
```
