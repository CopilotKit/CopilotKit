title: "Exit Agent"
---

To exit the agent, call `copilotkit_exit` This will exit the agent session as soon as the current LangGraph run is finished (either by a breakpoint or by reaching the `END` node)

```python
copilotkit_exit(config)
```

Exiting the agent has different effects in router-mode and in agent-mode:
- In router-mode, exiting agent mode hands off input handling back to the router (which can initiate chat, call actions, other agents, etc.).
- In agent mode, exiting the agent restarts the agent loop.
