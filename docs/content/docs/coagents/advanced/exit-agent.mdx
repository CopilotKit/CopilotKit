title: "Exiting the agent loop"
---

After your agent has finished a workflow, you'll usually want to explicitly end that loop by calling the `copilotkit_exit()` method in your Python code.

Exiting the agent has different effects depending on mode:

- **Router Mode**: Exiting the agent hands responsibility for handling input back to the router, which can initiate chat, call actions, other agents, etc. The router can return to this agent later (starting a new loop) to satisfy a user request.

- **Agent Lock Mode**: Exiting the agent restarts the workflow loop for the current agent.

In this example from [our email-sending app](https://github.com/copilotkit/copilotkit/tree/main/examples/coagents-qa), the `send_email` node explicitly exits, then manually sends a response back to the user as a `ToolMessage`:

```python
async def send_email_node(state: EmailAgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
    """Send an email."""

    config = copilotkit_customize_config(
        config,
        emit_messages=True,
    )

    await copilotkit_exit(config) # [!code highlight]

    # get the last message and cast to ToolMessage
    last_message = cast(ToolMessage, state["messages"][-1])
    if last_message.content == "CANCEL":
        await copilotkit_emit_message(config, "❌ Cancelled sending email.")
    else:
        await copilotkit_emit_message(config, "✅ Sent email.")

    return {
        "messages": state["messages"],
    }
```

This will exit the agent session as soon as the current LangGraph run is finished, either by a breakpoint or by reaching the `END` node.
