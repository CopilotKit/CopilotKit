### Setting the threadId

When setting the `threadId` property in CopilotKit, i.e:

<Callout>
  When using LangGraph platform, the `threadId` must be a UUID.
</Callout>

```tsx
<CopilotKit threadId="2140b272-7180-410d-9526-f66210918b13">
  <YourApp />
</CopilotKit>
```

CopilotKit will restore the complete state of the thread, including the messages, from the database. (See [Message Persistence](/coagents/advanced/message-persistence) for more details.)

### Loading Agent State

This means that the state of any agent will also be restored. For example:

```tsx
const { state } = useCoAgent({name: "research_agent"});

// state will now be the state of research_agent in the thread id given above
```
