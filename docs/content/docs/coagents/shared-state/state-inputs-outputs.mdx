description: Decide which state properties are received and returned to the frontend

## What is this?

Not all state properties are relevant for frontend-backend sharing.
This guide shows how to ensure only the right portion of state is communicated back and forth.

This guide is based on [LangGraph's Input/Output Schema feature](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/input_output_schema/)

## When should I use this?

Depending on your implementation, some properties are meant to be processed internally, while some others are the way for the UI to communicate user input.
In addition, some state properties contain a lot of information. Syncing them back and forth between the agent and UI can be costly, while it might not have any practical benefit.

## Implementation

<Callout>
    Due to LangGraph support, this feature is currently only available for Python agents
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Examine our old state
    LangGraph is stateful. As you transition between nodes, that state is updated and passed to the next node. For this example,
    let's assume that the state our agent should be using, can be described like this:
    ```python title="agent-py/sample_agent/agent.py"
    from copilotkit import CopilotKitState
    from typing import Literal

    class AgentState(CopilotKitState):
        question: str
        answer: str
        resources: List[str]
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Divide state to Input and Output
    Our example case lists several state properties, which with its own purpose:
      - The question is being asked by the user, expecting the llm to answer
      - The answer is what the LLM returns
      - The resources list will be used by the LLM to answer the question, and should not be communicated to the user, or set by them.

      ```python title="agent-py/sample_agent/agent.py"
      from copilotkit import CopilotKitState
      from typing import Literal

      # divide the state into 3
      class InputState(CopilotKitState):
        question: str

      class OutputState(CopilotKitState):
        answer: str

      class OverallState(InputState, OutputState):
        resources: List[str]

      # ...add the rest of the agent implementation

      # finally, before compiling the graph, we define the 3 state components
      builder = StateGraph(OverallState, input=InputState, output=OutputState)

      # add all the different nodes and edges and compile the graph
      builder.add_node(answer_node)
      builder.add_edge(START, "answer_node")
      builder.add_edge("answer_node", END)
      graph = builder.compile()
      ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Give it a try!
    Now that we know which state properties our agent emits, we can inspect the state and expect the following to happen:
    - While we are able to provide a question, we will not receive it back from the agent. If we are using it in our UI, we need to remember the UI is the source of truth for it
    - Answer will change once it's returned back from the agent
    - The UI has no access to resources.

    ```tsx
    import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

    type AgentState = {
      question: string;
      answer: string;
    }

    const { state } = useCoAgent<AgentState>({
      name: "sample_agent",
      initialState: {
        question: "How's is the weather in SF?",
      }
    });

    console.log(state) // You can expect seeing "answer" change, while the others are not returned from the agent
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
