LangGraph agents are written in Python, using the [LangGraph Python SDK](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) and an API runtime server such as FastAPI. This guide presumes you're familiar with LangGraph and FastAPI, and are looking to use CopilotKit to build a great user experience for your AI agent.

To enable Python remote actions and connect your agent to CopilotKit, you'll need our Python SDK which you can install using `pip` (or your Python package manager of choice):

```bash
pip install copilotkit --extra-index-url https://copilotkit.gateway.scarf.sh/simple/
```

With `copilotkit` installed, update your FastAPI server to import what you will need to initialize the SDK as well as our FastAPI and LangGraph integrations:

```python filename="server.py" showLineNumbers
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

# Import CopilotKit SDK and integrations
from copilotkit.integrations.fastapi import add_fastapi_endpoint
from copilotkit import CopilotKitSDK, LangGraphAgent

# Import your LangGraph agent; in this example, it's the variable
# named `basic_agent_app` in ./agent.py
from .agent import basic_agent_app

# Initialize the agent for use by CopilotKit; we'll name it "basic_agent"
basic_agent = LangGraphAgent(
    name="basic_agent",
    description="Agent that asks about the weather",
    agent=basic_agent_app,
)

# Next, initialize the SDK, passing in the agent
sdk = CopilotKitSDK(
    agents=[
        basic_agent
    ],
)

# Finally, add the remote actions endpoint to this API
add_fastapi_endpoint(app, sdk, "/copilotkit_remote")
```

Remember the name `basic_agent` as well as our API endpoint URL (`http://localhost:8000/copilotkit_remote`), we'll need them as we move on to integrating this agent into the frontend.

### Enabling remote agent actions in a Next.js app

#### Configure your LLM provider

<Tabs items={['OpenAI', 'Anthropic', 'Other LLM Providers']}>

<Tab value="OpenAI">

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project, if you haven't already, and add your OpenAI API key.

```plaintext filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Do you have a paid API key?">
  Please note that the code below uses GPT-4o, which requires a paid OpenAI API key.
  **If you are using a free OpenAI API key**, change the model to a different option such as "gpt-3.5-turbo".
</Callout>

Then create a new file called `src/lib/llmAdapter.ts`:

```ts filename="src/lib/llmAdapter.ts"
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import { OpenAIAdapter } from '@copilotkit/runtime';

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

const openaiAdapter = new OpenAIAdapter({ 
  openai,
  model: "gpt-4o"
});

export default openaiAdapter
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="Anthropic">
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project, if you haven't already, and add your Anthropic API key.

```plaintext filename=".env"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then create a new file called `src/lib/llmAdapter.ts`:

```ts filename="src/lib/llmAdapter.ts"
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
import { AnthropicAdapter } from '@copilotkit/runtime';

const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: 'my_api_key', // defaults to process.env["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]
});

const anthropicAdapter = new AnthropicAdapter({ anthropic });

export default anthropicAdapter
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="Other LLM Providers">
  To use a different LLM provider, you can follow the `OpenAI` instructions, but adapt them to use one of the other available LLM adapters listed below:

  <LLMAdapters />
</Tab>

</Tabs>

#### Set up Copilot Runtime server route

Currently, you will need to self-host the CopilotRuntime route in order to use CoAgents. Support in Copilot Cloud is coming soon.

<Tabs items={['Next.js App Router', 'Next.js Pages Router', 'Node.js Express']}>

  {/* Next.js App Router */}
  <Tab value="Next.js App Router">
    Next, create a new server route which will make the `CopilotRuntime` available at `/api/copilotkit` and ready to work with remote actions provided by our Python app.
    
    Create a new file at `src/app/api/copilotkit/route.ts` and add this code:

    ```ts filename="app/api/copilotkit/route.ts" showLineNumbers
    import {
      CopilotRuntime,
      copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint,
    } from '@copilotkit/runtime';
    import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
    import serviceAdapter from '@/lib/llmAdapter';

    const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
      remoteActions: [
        {
          url: `http://localhost:8000/copilotkit_remote`,
        }
      ]
    });

    export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
      const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
        runtime,
        serviceAdapter,
        endpoint: '/api/copilotkit',
      });

      return handleRequest(req);
    };
    ```
  </Tab>

  {/* Next.js Pages Router */}
  <Tab value="Next.js Pages Router">
    Next, create a new server route which will make the `CopilotRuntime` available at `/api/copilotkit` and ready to work with remote actions provided by our Python app.
    
    Create a new file at `src/pages/api/copilotkit.ts` and add this code:

    ```ts filename="pages/api/copilotkit.ts" showLineNumbers
    import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
    import {
      CopilotRuntime,
      copilotRuntimeNextJSPagesRouterEndpoint,
    } from '@copilotkit/runtime';
    import serviceAdapter from '@/lib/llmAdapter';

    const handler = async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {

      const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
        remoteActions: [
          {
            url: `http://localhost:8000/copilotkit_remote`,
          }
        ]
      });

      const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
        runtime,
        serviceAdapter,
        endpoint: '/api/copilotkit',
      });

      return await handleRequest(req, res);
    };

    export default handler;
    ```
  </Tab>

  {/* Node.js Express */}
  <Tab value="Node.js Express">
    Next, create a new route handler which will make the `CopilotRuntime` available at `/copilotkit` and ready to work with remote actions provided by our Python app:

    ```ts filename="server.ts" showLineNumbers
    import express from 'express';
    import {
      CopilotRuntime,
      copilotRuntimeNodeHttpEndpoint,
    } from '@copilotkit/runtime';
    import llmAdapter from '@/lib/llmAdapter';

    const app = express();

    app.use('/copilotkit', (req, res, next) => {

      const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
        remoteActions: [
          {
            url: `http://localhost:8000/copilotkit_remote`,
          }
        ]
      });
      
      const handler = copilotRuntimeNodeHttpEndpoint({
        endpoint: '/copilotkit',
        runtime,
        serviceAdapter: llmAdapter,
      });

      return handler(req, res, next);
    });

    app.listen(4000, () => {
      console.log('Listening at http://localhost:4000/copilotkit');
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Integrating agents into your CopilotKit frontend app

Once you've set up your agents and registered them with CopilotKit on the Python side, CopilotKit components in your frontend will **route** your users' interactions to the most appropriate agent. This default setting is called **router mode**.

Having set up our Next (or other) app's server route to work with the Python service, CopilotKit components should use your agents automatically:

```tsx filename="src/page.tsx"
// This UI will now invoke our AI agent, not just the LLM
<CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit">
  <CopilotChat
    labels={{
      title: "Popup Assistant",
      initial: "Need any help?",
    }}
  />
</CopilotKit>
```

Any of CopilotKit's pre-built components can be used to interact with CoAgents, and you can also use agent-specific hooks in your custom UI components to enable powerful new workflows.
