## Before you start

These docs assume you’ve been introduced to CopilotKit’s core concepts and components. If you’re new to CopilotKit, take a minute to go through the quickstart and [learn how to integrate CopilotKit into a React app](/quickstart).

Also, at the moment CoAgents integrates with LangGraph-powered agents using their Python SDK. (Support for LangGraph JS and LangGraph Cloud are coming soon!)

This guide assumes you’re familiar with using LangGraph to build agent workflows. If you need a quick introduction, check out [this brief example from the LangGraph docs](https://docs.langgraph.ai/quickstart).

<Steps>



<Step>

## Setup a remote endpoint in Python + FastAPI
CoAgents require you to use a remote endpoint using Python, FastAPI, and the CopilotKit Python SDK; here's a basic example to get you started. To learn more, see our [backend actions docs](/guides/backend-actions/remote-backend-endpoint).

In your Python project, install the CopilotKit SDK:

```bash
pip install copilotkit --extra-index-url https://copilotkit.gateway.scarf.sh/simple/
```

Then set up or update your FastAPI server to initialize our SDK and connect it to your LangGraph agent. In this example, we’re assuming a basic agent workflow is being exported from `agent.py` in the same directory as this server script.

```python filename="server.py" showLineNumbers
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
 
# Import CopilotKit SDK and integrations
from copilotkit.integrations.fastapi import add_fastapi_endpoint
from copilotkit import CopilotKitSDK, LangGraphAgent
 
# Import your LangGraph agent; in this example, it's the variable
# named `basic_agent_app` in ./agent.py
from .agent import basic_agent_app
 
# Initialize the agent for use by CopilotKit; we'll name it "basic_agent"
basic_agent = LangGraphAgent(
    name="basic_agent",
    description="Agent that asks about the weather",
    agent=basic_agent_app,
)
 
# Next, initialize the SDK, passing in the agent
sdk = CopilotKitSDK(
    agents=[
        basic_agent
    ],
)
 
# Finally, add the remote actions endpoint to this API
add_fastapi_endpoint(app, sdk, "/copilotkit_remote")
```

Remember the name `basic_agent` as well as our API endpoint URL (`http://localhost:8000/copilotkit_remote`), we'll need them as we move on to integrating this agent into the frontend.

</Step>


<Step>
## Self-host the Copilot Runtime

To use your remote agent service, you’ll also need to self-host the CopilotRuntime service. (Support for CopilotCloud is coming soon.)

### Configure an AI service adapter

First, we’ll create a new module file to initialize a runtime adapter for our LLM of choice, which we’ll put at `src/lib/serviceAdapter.ts`.


<Tabs items={['OpenAI', 'Anthropic', 'Other LLM Providers']}>

<Tab value="OpenAI">

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project, if you haven't already, and add your OpenAI API key.

```plaintext filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Do you have a paid API key?">
  Please note that the code below uses GPT-4o, which requires a paid OpenAI API key.
  **If you are using a free OpenAI API key**, change the model to a different option such as "gpt-3.5-turbo".
</Callout>

Then create a new file called `src/lib/llmAdapter.ts`:

```ts filename="src/lib/llmAdapter.ts"
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import { OpenAIAdapter } from '@copilotkit/runtime';

const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

const openaiAdapter = new OpenAIAdapter({ 
  openai,
  model: "gpt-4o"
});

export default openaiAdapter
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="Anthropic">
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project, if you haven't already, and add your Anthropic API key.

```plaintext filename=".env"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Then create a new file called `src/lib/llmAdapter.ts`:

```ts filename="src/lib/llmAdapter.ts"
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
import { AnthropicAdapter } from '@copilotkit/runtime';

const anthropic = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: 'my_api_key', // defaults to process.env["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]
});

const anthropicAdapter = new AnthropicAdapter({ anthropic });

export default anthropicAdapter
```
</Tab>

<Tab value="Other LLM Providers">
  To use a different LLM provider, you can follow the `OpenAI` instructions, but adapt them to use one of the other available LLM adapters listed below:

  <LLMAdapters />
</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Add a CopilotRuntime endpoint to your app

Next, you'll use the service adapter you created above to initialize a `CopilotRuntime` instance and add a new route to your app. Here are some examples for the most common Node server frameworks:

<Tabs items={['Next.js App Router', 'Next.js Pages Router', 'Node.js Express']}>

  {/* Next.js App Router */}
  <Tab value="Next.js App Router">
    Next, create a new server route which will make the `CopilotRuntime` available at `/api/copilotkit` and ready to work with remote actions provided by our Python app.
    
    Create a new file at `src/app/api/copilotkit/route.ts` and add this code:

    ```ts filename="app/api/copilotkit/route.ts" showLineNumbers
    import {
      CopilotRuntime,
      copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint,
    } from '@copilotkit/runtime';
    import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';
    import serviceAdapter from '@/lib/llmAdapter';

    const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
      remoteActions: [
        {
          url: `http://localhost:8000/copilotkit_remote`,
        }
      ]
    });

    export const POST = async (req: NextRequest) => {
      const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
        runtime,
        serviceAdapter,
        endpoint: '/api/copilotkit',
      });

      return handleRequest(req);
    };
    ```
  </Tab>

  {/* Next.js Pages Router */}
  <Tab value="Next.js Pages Router">
    Next, create a new server route which will make the `CopilotRuntime` available at `/api/copilotkit` and ready to work with remote actions provided by our Python app.
    
    Create a new file at `src/pages/api/copilotkit.ts` and add this code:

    ```ts filename="pages/api/copilotkit.ts" showLineNumbers
    import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
    import {
      CopilotRuntime,
      copilotRuntimeNextJSPagesRouterEndpoint,
    } from '@copilotkit/runtime';
    import serviceAdapter from '@/lib/llmAdapter';

    const handler = async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {

      const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
        remoteActions: [
          {
            url: `http://localhost:8000/copilotkit_remote`,
          }
        ]
      });

      const { handleRequest } = copilotRuntimeNextJSAppRouterEndpoint({
        runtime,
        serviceAdapter,
        endpoint: '/api/copilotkit',
      });

      return await handleRequest(req, res);
    };

    export default handler;
    ```
  </Tab>

  {/* Node.js Express */}
  <Tab value="Node.js Express">
    Next, create a new route handler which will make the `CopilotRuntime` available at `/copilotkit` and ready to work with remote actions provided by our Python app:

    ```ts filename="server.ts" showLineNumbers
    import express from 'express';
    import {
      CopilotRuntime,
      copilotRuntimeNodeHttpEndpoint,
    } from '@copilotkit/runtime';
    import llmAdapter from '@/lib/llmAdapter';

    const app = express();

    app.use('/copilotkit', (req, res, next) => {

      const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
        remoteActions: [
          {
            url: `http://localhost:8000/copilotkit_remote`,
          }
        ]
      });
      
      const handler = copilotRuntimeNodeHttpEndpoint({
        endpoint: '/copilotkit',
        runtime,
        serviceAdapter: llmAdapter,
      });

      return handler(req, res, next);
    });

    app.listen(4000, () => {
      console.log('Listening at http://localhost:4000/copilotkit');
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


</Step>


<Step>

## Integrate agents into your CopilotKit frontend app

Once you've set up your agents, registered them with CopilotKit on the Python side, and mounted the CopilotRuntime within your app, all that's left is to hook this up to your frontend using the `<CopilotKit />` component.

```tsx filename="src/page.tsx"
// This UI will now invoke our AI agent, not just the LLM
<CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit" agent="basic_agent">
  <CopilotChat
    labels={{
      title: "Popup Assistant",
      initial: "Need any help?",
    }}
  />
</CopilotKit>
```

By passing in the `agent` prop, we're telling CopilotKit to go into "agent lock" mode, and only use the `basic_agent` we set up earlier. To customize this behavior, see our docs about [router mode](/coagents/advanced/router-mode-agent-lock).

Any of CopilotKit's pre-built components can be used to interact with CoAgents, and you can also use agent-specific hooks in your custom UI components to enable powerful new workflows.
