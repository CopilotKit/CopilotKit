  Pictured above is the [coagent starter](https://github.com/copilotkit/copilotkit/tree/main/examples/coagent-starter) with
  the implementation below applied!
</Callout>

## What is this?
[Node based flows](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/v0-human-in-the-loop/#dynamic-breakpoints) are predicated on LangGraph concept
of `breakpoints` which will interrupt a node before or after its execution to allow for user input.

CopilotKit allows you to add custom UI to take user input and then pass it back to the agent upon completion.

## Why should I use this?

Human-in-the-loop is a powerful way to implement complex workflows that are production ready. By having a human in the loop,
you can ensure that the agent is always making the right decisions and ultimately is being steered in the right direction.

Node-based flows are a great way to implement HITL for more complex workflows where you want to ensure the agent is aware
of everything that has happened during a HITL interaction. This is contrasted with interrupt-based flows, where the agent
is interrupted and then resumes execution from where it left off, unaware of the context of the interaction by default.

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Run and connect your agent
        <RunAndConnectAgentSnippet />
    </Step>
    
    <Step>
      ### Install the CopilotKit SDK
      <InstallSDKSnippet components={props.components}/>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Add a `useCopilotAction` to your Frontend
        First, we'll create a component that renders the agent's essay draft and waits for user approval.

        ```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
        import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core"
        import { Markdown } from "@copilotkit/react-ui"

        function YourMainContent() {
          // ...

          useCopilotAction({ 
            name: "writeEssay",
            available: "remote",
            description: "Writes an essay and takes the draft as an argument.",
            parameters: [
              { name: "draft", type: "string", description: "The draft of the essay", required: true },
            ],
            // [!code highlight:25]
            renderAndWaitForResponse: ({ args, respond, status }) => {
              return (
                <div>
                  <Markdown content={args.draft || 'Preparing your draft...'} />
                  
                  <div className={`flex gap-4 pt-4 ${status !== "executing" ? "hidden" : ""}`}>
                    <button 
                      onClick={() => respond?.("CANCEL")}
                      disabled={status !== "executing"}
                      className="border p-2 rounded-xl w-full"
                    >
                      Try Again
                    </button>
                    <button
                      onClick={() => respond?.("SEND")}
                      disabled={status !== "executing"} 
                      className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded-xl w-full"
                    >
                      Approve Draft
                    </button>
                  </div>
                </div>
              );
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Setup the LangGraph Agent
    Now we'll setup the LangGraph agent. Node-based flows are hard to understand without a complete example, so below
    is the complete implementation of the agent with explanations.

    Some main things to note:
    - The agent's state inherits from `CopilotKitState` to bring in the CopilotKit actions.
    - CopilotKit's actions are binded to the model as tools.
    - If the `writeEssay` action is found in the model's response, the agent will transition to the `user_feedback_node`.
    - The agent is interrupted before the `user_feedback_node` to allow for user input.

    ```python title="agent/sample_agent/agent.py"
    from typing_extensions import Literal
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, AIMessage
    from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
    from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
    from langgraph.types import Command
    from copilotkit import CopilotKitState

    # 1. Define our agent's state and inherit from CopilotKitState, this brings in the CopilotKit actions
    class AgentState(CopilotKitState): # [!code highlight]
        # 1.1 Define any other state variables
        pass

    # 2. Define the chat node, this will be where the agent will talk to user and
    #    decide if it needs to call the writeEssay tool
    async def chat_node(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig) -> Command[Literal["user_feedback_node", "__end__"]]:
        # 2.1 Define the model and bind CopilotKit's actions as tools
        model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
        model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([*state.get("copilotkit", {}).get("actions", [])]) # [!code highlight]

        # 2.2 Define the system message
        system_message = SystemMessage(
            content="You write essays. Use your tools to write an essay, don't just write it in plain text."
        )

        # 2.3 Run the model to generate a response
        response = await model_with_tools.ainvoke([
            system_message,
            *state["messages"],
        ], config)

        # [!code highlight:6]
        # 2.4 Check for the writeEssay tool call and, if found, go  to the
        #     user_feedback_node to handle the user's response
        if isinstance(response, AIMessage) and response.tool_calls:
            if response.tool_calls[0].get("name") == "writeEssay":
                return Command(goto="user_feedback_node", update={"messages": response})

        # 2.5 If no tool call is found, end the agent
        return Command(goto=END, update={"messages": response})

    # 3. Define the user_feedback_node, this node will be interrupted before execution
    #    where CopilotKit's renderAndWaitForResponse provide the user's response.
    def user_feedback_node(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig) -> Command[Literal["chat_node"]]:
        # [!code highlight:4]
        # 3.1 Get the last message from the state, this will be 
        #     what is returned by respond() in the frontend
        last_message = state["messages"][-1]

        # 3.2 If the user declined the essay, ask them how they'd like to improve it
        if last_message.content != "SEND":
            return Command(goto="chat_node", update={
                "messages": [SystemMessage(content="The user declined they essay, please ask them how they'd like to improve it")]
            })

        # 3.3 If the user approved the essay, ask them if they'd like anything else
        return Command(goto="chat_node", update={
            "messages": [SystemMessage(content="The user approved the essay, ask them if they'd like anything else")]
        })

    # 4. Configure the workflow
    workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
    workflow.add_node("chat_node", chat_node)
    workflow.add_node("user_feedback_node", user_feedback_node)
    workflow.set_entry_point("chat_node")

    # [!code highlight:3]
    # 5. Compile the workflow and set the interrupt_before property
    graph = workflow.compile(MemorySaver(), interrupt_before=["user_feedback_node"])
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        Try asking your agent to write an essay about the benefits of AI. You'll see that it will generate an essay,
        stream the progress and eventually ask you to review it.
