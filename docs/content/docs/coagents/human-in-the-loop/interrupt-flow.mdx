## What is this?

[LangGraph's interrupt flow](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/) provides an intuitive way to implement Human-in-the-loop workflows.

This guide will show you how to both use `interrupt` and how to integrate it with CopilotKit.

## When should I use this?

This flow is useful when you want to interrupt the agent's flow to get user input.

## Implementation

### Run and connect your agent

### Call `interrupt` in your LangGraph agent

<Tabs items={['Python', 'TypeScript']} default="Python">
    <Tab value="Python">
        ```python title="agent/sample_agent/agent.py"
        from langgraph.types import interrupt # [!code highlight]

        # ...

        def chat_node(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
            agent_name = state.get("agent_name")
            if not agent_name:
                # Interrupt and wait for the user to respond with a name
                agent_name = interrupt(f"Before we start, what would you like to call me?") # [!code highlight]

                # Go back to the chat node and update the state with the name
                return Command(goto="chat_node", update={"agent_name": agent_name})

            # Tell the agent its name
            system_message = SystemMessage(
                content=f"You are a helpful assistant named {agent_name}..."
            )

            # ...
        ```
    </Tab>

### Handle the interrupt in your frontend
At this point, your LangGraph agent's `interrupt` will be called. However, we currently have no handling for rendering or 
responding to the interrupt in the frontend.

To do this, we'll use the `useLangGraphInterrupt` hook, give it a component to render, and then call `resolve` with the user's response.

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { useLangGraphInterrupt } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]
// ...

const YourMainContent = () => {
  // ...
  // [!code highlight:15]
  // styles omitted for brevity
  useLangGraphInterrupt({
    render: ({ event, resolve }) => (
      <div>
        <p>{event.value}</p>
        <form onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          resolve((e.target as HTMLFormElement).response.value);
        }}>
          <input type="text" name="response" placeholder="Enter your response" />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    )
  });
  // ...

  return <div>{/* ... */}</div>
}
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Give it a try!
Try talking to your agent, you'll see that it now pauses execution and waits for you to respond!
