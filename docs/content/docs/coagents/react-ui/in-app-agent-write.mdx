You can easily sync your application state back to the agent state.

## Frontend

<Steps>

<Step>
### Simply call the `useCoAgent` hook and capture the `setState` variable.

```tsx
// [!code word:setState]
import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]

// Example usage in a pseudo React component
function WeatherComponent() {
  const { state, setState } = useCoAgent<WeatherAgentState>({
    name: "basic_agent",
    initialState: { input: "New York City" }  // optionally provide an initial state
  });

  // Use weatherAgentState in your component logic and rendering
  // ...

  return (
    // Render your component using weatherAgentState
  );
}
```

</Step>

<Step>
### When you are ready, call the `setState` function
```tsx
// ...
setState(theNewState)
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Manually run the agent if necessary

The new agent state will be used next time the agent runs.
If you want to re-run it manually, use the `run` argument on the `useCoAgent` hook.

The agent will be re-run, and it will get not only the latest updated state, <br/>
but also a **hint** that can depend on the data delta between the previous and the current state.

```tsx
// [!code word:run]
import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import { TextMessage, MessageRole } from "@copilotkit/runtime-client-gql";  // [!code highlight]

// Example usage in a pseudo React component
function WeatherComponent() {
  const { state, setState, run } = useCoAgent<WeatherAgentState>({
    name: "basic_agent",
    initialState: { input: "New York City" }  // optionally provide an initial state
  });

  // setup to be called when some event in the app occurs
  const handleForecastUpdated = (newForecast: string) => {
    setState({forecast: string})

    // re-run the agent and provide a hint about what's changed
    run(({ previousState, currentState }) => { // [!code highlight:6]
      return new TextMessage({
        role: MessageRole.User,
        content: "the forecast has been updated",
      });
    });
  };

  return (
    // Render your component using weatherAgentState
  );
}
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## Agentic backend (LangGraph)

<Steps>
<Step>

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT! Stream & render the intermediate agent state

By default, the LangGraph agent state will only update _between_ LangGraph node transitions --
which means state updates will be discontinuous and delayed.

You likely want to render the agent state as it updates **continuously.** See **[stream intermediate state](/coagents/advanced/intermediate-state-streaming).**

## Example

See the [Shared State example](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/examples/coagents-shared-state) for a simple example demonstrating getting and setting state shared state.
