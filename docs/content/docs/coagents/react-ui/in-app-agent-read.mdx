**You can easily use the realtime agent state not only in the chat UI, but also in the native application UX.**

## Frontend

<Steps>
<Step>

Simply call the `useCoAgent` hook, and pass the agent's name.


```tsx
import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]

// Example usage in a pseudo React component
function WeatherComponent() {
  const { state } = useCoAgent<WeatherAgentState>({ // [!code highlight:4]
    name: "basic_agent",
    initialState: { input: "New York City" }  // optionally provide an initial state
  });

  // Use state in your component logic and rendering
  // ...

  return (
    // Render your component using state
  );
}
```

</Step>


<Step>
As the agent state updates, your `state` variable will automatically update with it!

## Agentic backend (LangGraph)
<Steps>
<Step>

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT! Stream & render the intermediate agent state
By default, the LangGraph agent state will only update *between* LangGraph node transitions --
which means state updates will be discontinuous and delayed.

You likely want to render the agent state as it updates **continuously.**<br/>
See **[stream intermediate state](/coagents/advanced/intermediate-state-streaming).**
