Welcome to the CoAgents Troubleshooting Guide! If you're having trouble getting tool calls to work, you've come to the right place.

## My tool calls are not being streamed

This could be due to a few different reasons. 

First, we strongly recommend checking out our [Human In the Loop](/docs/coagents/chat-ui/hitl/json-hitl) guide to follow a more in depth example of how to stream tool calls
in your LangGraph agents. You can also check out our [travel tutorial](/coagents/tutorials/ai-travel-app/step-6-human-in-the-loop) which talks about how to stream
tool calls in a more complex example.

If you have already done that, you can check the following:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="You're using llm.invoke() instead of llm.ainvoke()">
        <p>
            When you invoke your LangGraph agent, you can invoke it synchronously or asynchronously. If you invoke it synchronously,
            the tool calls will not be streamed progressively, only the final result will be streamed. If you invoke it asynchronously,
            the tool calls will be streamed progressively.

            ```python
            response = await llm_with_tools.ainvoke(
                [ SystemMessage(content=system_message), *state["messages"] ],
                config=config
            )
            ```
        </p>
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Error: `'AzureOpenAI' object has no attribute 'bind_tools'`

This error is typically due to the use of an incorrect import from LangGraph. Instead of importing `AzureOpenAI` import `AzureChatOpenAI` and your
issue will be resolved.

```python
from langchain_openai import AzureOpenAI # [!code --]
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI # [!code ++]
```
