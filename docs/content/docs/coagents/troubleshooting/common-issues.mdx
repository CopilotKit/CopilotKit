Welcome to the CoAgents Troubleshooting Guide! If you're having trouble getting tool calls to work, you've come to the right place.

## My tool calls are not being streamed

This could be due to a few different reasons. 

First, we strongly recommend checking out our [Human In the Loop](/docs/coagents/chat-ui/hitl/json-hitl) guide to follow a more in depth example of how to stream tool calls
in your LangGraph agents. You can also check out our [travel tutorial](/coagents/tutorials/ai-travel-app/step-6-human-in-the-loop) which talks about how to stream
tool calls in a more complex example.

If you have already done that, you can check the following:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="You have not specified the tool call in the `copilotkit_customize_config`">
        In your LangGraph agent, you have must specify which tool calls will be emitted to the CopilotKit runtime. By default,
        only streamed messages are emitted. You can fix this by adding the following to the node making the tool call.

        ```python
        from copilotkit.langgraph import copilotkit_customize_config, copilotkit_emit_message
        from langgraph_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
        from langchain.tools import tool

        @tool
        def say_hello_to(name: str) -> str:
            return f"Hello, {name}!"

        async def my_node(state: State, config: RunnableConfig) -> State:
            # ...
            config = copilotkit_customize_config(config, emit_tool_calls=["say_hello_to"]) # [code highlight]
            # ...
            return state
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="You're using llm.invoke() instead of llm.ainvoke()">
        <p>
            When you invoke your LangGraph agent, you can invoke it synchronously or asynchronously. If you invoke it synchronously,
            the tool calls will not be streamed progressively, only the final result will be streamed. If you invoke it asynchronously,
            the tool calls will be streamed progressively.

            ```python
            config = copilotkit_customize_config(config, emit_tool_calls=["say_hello_to"])
            response = await llm_with_tools.ainvoke(
                [ SystemMessage(content=system_message), *state["messages"] ],
                config=config
            )
            ```
        </p>
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Error: `'AzureOpenAI' object has no attribute 'bind_tools'`

This error is typically due to the use of an incorrect import from LangGraph. Instead of importing `AzureOpenAI` import `AzureChatOpenAI` and your
issue will be resolved.

```python
from langchain_openai import AzureOpenAI # [!code --]
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI # [!code ++]
```

## I am getting "agent not found" error

If you're seeing this error, it means CopilotKit couldn't find the LangGraph agent you're trying to use. Here's how to fix it:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Verify your agent lock mode configuration">
        If you're using [agent lock mode](/coagents/advanced/router-mode-agent-lock#agent-lock-mode),
        check that the agent defined in `langgraph.json` matches what's defined in the CopilotKit provider:

        ```json title="langgraph.json"
        {
            "python_version": "3.12",
            "dockerfile_lines": [],
            "dependencies": ["."],
            "graphs": {
                "my_agent": "./src/agent.py:graph"// In this case, "my_agent" is the agent you're using // [!code highlight]
            },
            "env": ".env"
        }
        ```

        ```tsx title="layout.tsx"
        <CopilotKit agent="my_agent"> // [!code highlight]
            {/* Your application components */}
        </CopilotKit>
        ```

        Common issues:
        - Typos in agent names
        - Case sensitivity mismatches
        - Missing entries in `langgraph.json`
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Check your agent registration on a LangGraph Platform endpoint">
        When using LangGraph Platform endpoint, make sure your agents are properly specified and are following the definition in your `langgraph.json`:

        ```json title="langgraph.json"
        {
            "python_version": "3.12",
            "dockerfile_lines": [],
            "dependencies": ["."],
            "graphs": {
                "my_agent": "./src/agent.py:graph"// In this case, "my_agent" is the agent you're using // [!code highlight]
            },
            "env": ".env"
        }
        ```

        ```typescript title="/copilotkit/api/route.ts"
        langGraphPlatformEndpoint({
            deploymentUrl,
            langsmithApiKey,
            agents: [
                {
                    name: "my_agent",
                    description: "A helpful agent",
                },
            ],
        })
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Check your agent name in useCoAgent">
        Make sure the that the agent defined in `langgraph.json` matches what you use n `useCoAgent` hook:

        ```json title="langgraph.json"
        {
            "python_version": "3.12",
            "dockerfile_lines": [],
            "dependencies": ["."],
            "graphs": {
                "my_agent": "./src/agent.py:graph"// In this case, "my_agent" is the agent you're using // [!code highlight]
            },
            "env": ".env"
        }
        ```

        ```tsx title="MyComponent.tsx"
        // Your React component
        useCoAgent({
            name: "my_agent", // [!code focus] This must match exactly
        });
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Check your agent name in useCoAgentStateRender">
        Make sure the that the agent defined in `langgraph.json` matches what you use n `useCoAgent` hook:

        ```json title="langgraph.json"
        {
            "python_version": "3.12",
            "dockerfile_lines": [],
            "dependencies": ["."],
            "graphs": {
                "my_agent": "./src/agent.py:graph"// In this case, "my_agent" is the agent you're using // [!code highlight]
            },
            "env": ".env"
        }
        ```

        ```tsx title="MyComponent.tsx"
        // Your React component
        useCoAgentStateRender({
            name: "my_agent", // [!code focus] This must match exactly
        });
        ```
