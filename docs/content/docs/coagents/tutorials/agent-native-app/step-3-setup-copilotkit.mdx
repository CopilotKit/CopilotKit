import { GoServer } from "react-icons/go";
import { FaCloud } from "react-icons/fa";
import { ImageZoom } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/image-zoom';

Now that we have the application and agent running, we're ready to connect both via CopilotKit. For this tutorial, the following CopilotKit dependencies
are already installed in the `frontend` directory.

- `@copilotkit/react-core`: The core library for CopilotKit, which contains the CopilotKit provider and useful hooks.
- `@copilotkit/react-ui`: The UI library for CopilotKit, which contains the CopilotKit UI components such as the sidebar, chat popup, textarea and more.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create an account on Copilot Cloud
CopilotKit comes with a production-ready proxy to your LLMs which we call Runtime. This Runtime component can be hosted on your own servers or 
via our managed Copilot Cloud service. In this tutorial, we'll be using Copilot Cloud, but feel free to use our [self-hosting option](/guides/self-hosting) if you'd like.

First, you'll need [to create an account for Copilot Cloud here](https://cloud.copilotkit.ai/sign-in).

<Callout type="info">
  Copilot Cloud is free to use and comes with free LLM credits to get you started.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>
### Get a Copilot Cloud API Key

Once logged in, you'll see some on boarding steps. The main thing we'll need is a public API key. To do this,
you'll need to create an OpenAI API key and provide it to Copilot Cloud.

<ImageZoom src="/images/coagents/tutorials/ai-travel-app/cpkCloudSetup.png" alt="CopilotCloud API Key" height={1000} width={1000} />

</Step>
<Step>
### Setting up the environment variables

First, create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory.

```shell
touch frontend/.env
```

Then, add your Copilot Cloud API key to the file like so:

```txt title="frontend/.env"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CPK_PUBLIC_API_KEY=...
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Configure the CopilotKit Provider

Now we're ready to configure the CopilotKit provider in our application.

```tsx title="frontend/src/app/layout.tsx"
"use client";

// ...
import { CopilotKit } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code ++]
import "@copilotkit/react-ui/styles.css"; // [!code ++]
// ...

export default function RootLayout({ children }: Readonly<{ children: React.ReactNode }>) {
    return (
      <html lang="en" className="h-full">
        <body className={`${lato.variable} ${noto.className} antialiased h-full`}>
          // [!code ++:4]
          <CopilotKit
            publicApiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CPK_PUBLIC_API_KEY}
          >
            <TooltipProvider>
              <ResearchProvider>
                {children}
              </ResearchProvider>
            </TooltipProvider>
          </CopilotKit> // [!code ++]
        </body>
      </html>
    );
}
```
<Step>

### Adding a chat interface

We provide several customizeable components for you to interact with your copilot. Some of these are [`<CopilotPopup/>`](/reference/components/chat/CopilotPopup), [`<CopilotSidebar/>`](/reference/components/chat/CopilotSidebar), and [`<CopilotChat/>`](/reference/components/chat/CopilotChat), and your own fully custom UI via [`useCopilotChat`](/reference/hooks/useCopilotChat).

In this tutorial, we'll use the `<CopilotChat/>` component as we want to aim for a non-modal chat interface.

<Callout>
  The `Chat` component will serve as a wrapper around the CopilotKit `CopilotChat` component. This is to help simplify
  what you'll need to write along the way.
</Callout>

```tsx title="frontend/src/components/Chat.tsx"
"use client"

import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
import { INITIAL_MESSAGE, MAIN_CHAT_INSTRUCTIONS, MAIN_CHAT_TITLE } from "@/lib/consts";

export default function Chat({ onSubmitMessage }: { onSubmitMessage: () => void }) {
  return (
      // [!code ++:10]
      <CopilotChat
          instructions={MAIN_CHAT_INSTRUCTIONS}
          labels={{
              title: MAIN_CHAT_TITLE,
              initial: INITIAL_MESSAGE,
          }}
          className="h-full w-full font-noto"
          onSubmitMessage={onSubmitMessage}
      />
      // [!code --:4]
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold flex items-center justify-center h-full mx-auto mr-20">
        It'd be really cool if we had chat here!
      </h1>
  )
}
```

</Step>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Recap

And we're done! Here's what we did:

- We setup our Copilot cloud account and got an API key.
- We configured the CopilotKit provider in our application to use our API key.
- We added the CopilotSidebar to our application.

Now, head back to the app and you'll find a chat interface on the left side of the page. At this point, you can start interacting with your copilot! ðŸŽ‰

This is a very simple copilot that isn't talking to our LangGraph yet. In the next step, we'll be adding the LangGraph agent to the mix.
