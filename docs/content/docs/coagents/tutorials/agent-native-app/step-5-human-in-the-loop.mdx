Now that we have the ability to chat with our agent, we can move on to implementing human-in-the-loop. This is where the user can review the agent's output and provide feedback. We'll be
implementing this in our application by allowing the user to review and approve an outline prior to the research being conducted.

<Steps>
<Step>
## Understanding Human-in-the-Loop

In LangGraph, the current suggested way to implement human-in-the-loop is to use the [interrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/) method. Calling this
function will pause the node at the call site and rerun the node with the user's decision. You can learn more about interrupt [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/how-tos/interrupt_concurrent/?h=interrupt).

All together, this process will look like this:

    <img src="/images/coagents/coagents-hitl-infographic.png" alt="Human in the loop" />
</Frame>

The implementation of all of this is actually quite simple, but understanding how it all fits together is key.
</Step>
<Step>
## Add `useLangGraphInterrupt` to the frontend

If you recall from when we started the agent, the interrupt will stop the node when its time to review a proposed research outline.

CopilotKit allows us to render a UI to get the user's decision for this interrupt and respond accordingly via the `useLangGraphInterrupt` hook.

In our `page.tsx` file, add the following code.
```tsx title="frontend/src/app/page.tsx"
// ...
import { useLangGraphInterrupt } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code ++]
// ...

export default function HomePage() {
    // ...
    const { state: researchState, setResearchState } = useResearch()

    const streamingSection = useStreamingContent(researchState);

    // [!code ++:12]
    useLangGraphInterrupt<Proposal>({
      render: ({ resolve, event }) => {
        return <ProposalViewer
          proposal={event.value}
          onSubmit={(approved, proposal) => resolve(
            JSON.stringify({
              ...proposal,
              approved,
            })
          )}
        />
      }
    })
    // ...
}
```

Now, when the LangGraph is interrupted the `ProposalViewer` component will be rendered to the user with the `event.value` as the proposal. On submit, the hook's `resolve` function
will be called with the user's decision.

<Callout>
Checkout the `ProposalViewer` component code in the `frontend/src/components/ProposalViewer.tsx` file for more details about rendering.

It's just a standard React component with some styling, a form, and a submit button.
</Callout>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Recap
It is really as simple as that! Now, we've implemented human-in-the-loop for our agent. To recap, we did the following:
- Learned about human-in-the-loop in LangGraph.
- Added the `useLangGraphInterrupt` hook to our application.
- Rendered a `ProposalViewer` component to the user in the chat

Try asking the agent to research something, like Dogs. Eventually you'll see it ask you for feedback about the proposal.

```
Please research dogs!
```

Now, we can completely run our agent from start to finish to conduct research. However, you may notice that the research does not populate in the right window
as it completes. In the next step, we'll leverage the CoAgent concept of shared state to populate the research in the right window.
