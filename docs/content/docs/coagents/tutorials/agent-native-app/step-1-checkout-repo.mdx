title: "Step 1: Checkout the repo"
---

<Steps>
<Step>
### Checkout the starting branch
We'll be working with the [open-research-ana repository](https://github.com/CopilotKit/open-research-ana), specifically using a branch called `tutorial-start`. This branch contains the starting code for our research ANA tutorial.

```shell
git clone -b tutorial-start https://github.com/CopilotKit/open-research-ana.git
```

The repository contains two directories:
- `frontend/`: A NextJS application where we'll integrate our LangGraph agent
- `agent/`: A Python-based LangGraph agent that we'll be tweaking with the CopilotKit SDK

</Step>
<Step>
### Install frontend dependencies
First, let's set up the NextJS application. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the dependencies:

```shell
cd frontend
pnpm install
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Start the frontend
Launch the development server:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the research ANA in action. In its current state, you'll see an empty chat interface,
and empty document. 

This will be our starting point for the tutorial.
</Step>

Next, let's understand the LangGraph agent and how it works.
