At this point, we have a LangGraph agent running in LangGraph Studio and have a simple copilot. Now, let's 
combine the two together to make an copilot agent (CoAgent)!

<Steps>
<Step>
## Connect the agent to CopilotKit
We need to make CopilotKit aware of our running LangGraph agent. To do this, we will setup a remote 
endpoint to connect to our locally running agent.

Since we're using Copilot Cloud, this is as simple as running the following command for local development.

```bash
npx copilotkit@latest dev --port 8000
```
```sh
âœ” Select a project Local (ID: <project_id>)
âœ… LangGraph Platform endpoint detected
â ¹ Creating tunnel...

Tunnel Information:

â€¢ Tunnel URL:            https://<tunnel_id>.tunnels.devcopilotkit.com
â€¢ Endpoint Type:         LangGraph Platform
â€¢ Project:               projects/<project_id>

Press Ctrl+C to stop the tunnel

âœ” ðŸš€ Local tunnel is live and linked to Copilot Cloud!
```

This allows Copilot Cloud to know where to send requests to when the agent is called.

</Step>
<Step>
## Specify the agent to use

Now we need to let the CopilotKit provider know which agent to use, we can do this by specifying the `agent` prop.
<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Multi-Agent Routing">
By default, CopilotKit will intelligently route requests to the appropriate agent based on context. This allows 
you to have multiple agents and actions and not have to worry about manually routing requests.

In our case however, we only have a single agent and its ideal to lock all requests to that agent. We can do this
by updating the props of our `CopilotKit` provider.

</Accordions>

Our agent name is `agent` which is specified in the `langgraph.json` file.

```tsx title="frontend/src/app/layout.tsx"
// ...
<CopilotKit
  // ...
  agent="agent" // [!code ++]
>
  {...}
</CopilotKit>
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Recap
And we're done! Here's what we did:

- We connected the agent to CopilotKit.
- We specified the agent to use.

Now when you head back to the app, you'll notice that we're talking to our LangGraph agent!

Next, let's process and sync the state between our application and the agent.
