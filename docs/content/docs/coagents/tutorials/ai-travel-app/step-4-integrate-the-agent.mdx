title: "Step 4: Integrate the Agent"
---
At this point, we have a LangGraph agent running in LangGraph Studioand have our own non-agentic copilot that we can interact with. Now, let's 
combine the two together to make an agentic copilot!

## The React State

Let's quickly review how the app's state works. Open up the [`lib/hooks/use-trips.tsx`](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/blob/coagents-travel-tutorial-start/examples/coagents-travel/ui/lib/hooks/use-trips.tsx) file.

At a glance, we can see that the file exposes a provider (`TripsProvider`), which defines a lot useful things. The main thing we care about is the `state` object which takes the shape of the `AgentState` type. This is consumable by a `useTrips` hook, which we use in the rest of the application (feel free to check out the `TripCard`, 
`TripContent` and `TripSelect` components).

This resembles the majority of React apps, where frontend state, either for a feature or the entire app, is managed by a context or state management library.

## Integrate the Agent

To integrate the agent into this state, we're going to need to register an agent with CopilotKit and then use the `useCoAgent` hook to connect the two.

<Steps>
<Step>
## Register the agent

Make sure you have the LangGraph Studio endpoint from the previous step!

<Tabs groupId="hosting" items={['Copilot Cloud', 'Self-Hosted']}>
<Tab value="Copilot Cloud">
We're going to use the CopilotKit CLI to setup a tunnel between our locally running LangGraph agent and Copilot Cloud. You'll 
need the port number of the LangGraph Studio endpoint we setup earlier.

<Callout title="Looking for the port number?">
It'll be on the bottom left of the LangGraph Studio interface like this.

  <img src="https://cdn.copilotkit.ai/docs/copilotkit/images/coagents/tutorials/ai-travel-app/lgs-endpoint.png" alt="LangGraph Studio Endpoint" />
</Frame>

</Callout>

To open a tunnel, run the following command.

```bash
# replace <port_number> with the port number of the LangGraph Studio endpoint
npx copilotkit@latest dev --port <port_number>
```

It will guide you through the process of selecting a project and creating a tunnel. You should see output similar to the following.

```bash
✔ Select a project Local (ID: <project_id>)
✅ LangGraph Platform endpoint detected
⠹ Creating tunnel...

Tunnel Information:

• Tunnel URL:            https://<tunnel_id>.tunnels.devcopilotkit.com
• Endpoint Type:         LangGraph Platform
• Project:               projects/<project_id>

Press Ctrl+C to stop the tunnel

✔ 🚀 Local tunnel is live and linked to Copilot Cloud!
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Self-Hosted">

In our previously setup `/api/copilotkit` route, we're going to add the following.

```tsx title="ui/app/api/copilotkit/route.ts"
// ...

import { CopilotRuntime, LangGraphAgent } from '@copilotkit/runtime'; // [!code ++]

// ...

const runtime = new CopilotRuntime();// [!code --]
// [!code ++:10]
const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
  agents: { // [!code highlight:8]
    'travel': new LangGraphAgent({
      deploymentUrl: "http://localhost:<port_number>",
      graphId: 'travel',
      langsmithApiKey: "your-langsmith-api-key" // Optional
    }),
  },
});

// ...
```

<Callout>
The `deploymentUrl` is the URL from LangGraph Studio but it can also be a graph hosted in LangGraph Platform!
</Callout>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

This allows CopilotKit to know where to send requests to when the agent is called.

</Step>
<Step>
## Lock the agent

By default, CopilotKit will intelligently route requests to the appropriate agent based on context. This allows 
you to have multiple agents and actions and not have to worry about manually routing requests.

In our case however, we only have a single agent and its ideal to lock all requests to that agent. We can do this
by updating the props of our `CopilotKit` provider.

<Callout>
Want to learn more about multi-agent routing? Checkout out the [multi-agent concept guide](/coagents/multi-agent-flows).
</Callout>

```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
// ...
<CopilotKit
  // ...
  agent="travel" // [!code ++]
>
  {...}
</CopilotKit>
```

This will ensure that every request is sent to the `travel` agent. The `travel` name is defined in the [agents/langgraph.json](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/blob/main/examples/coagents-travel/agent/langgraph.json)
file. When we deploy our agent to Copilot Cloud this is automatically handled for us. When self-hosting, we need to specify the name of the agent in the `langGraphPlatformEndpoint` constructor.
</Step>
<Step>

## The `useCoAgent` hook

LangGraph agents are stateful, meaning that they can maintain their own state. We saw this earlier when we were using LangGraph Studio, in the bottom left. We
also have the application's state through React.

Our current goal is to create a bidirectional connection between these two states. Luckily, the [`useCoAgent`](/reference/hooks/useCoAgent) hook makes this easy.

```tsx title="ui/lib/hooks/use-trips.tsx" {3,8-11}
// ...
// [!code word:AgentState:1]
import { Trip, Place, AgentState, defaultTrips} from "@/lib/trips"; 
import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code ++]

export const TripsProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  // [!code --:5]
  const [state, setState] = useState<{ trips: Trip[], selected_trip_id: string | null }>({ 
    trips: defaultTrips, 
    selected_trip_id: defaultTrips && defaultTrips[0] ? defaultTrips[0].id : null 
  });
  // [!code ++:9]
  const { state, setState } = useCoAgent<AgentState>({
    name: "travel",
    initialState: {
      trips: defaultTrips,
      selected_trip_id: defaultTrips[0].id,
    },
  });

  // ...
```

<Callout>
The `useCoAgent` hook is generic. What this means is that we can specify a type for that represents the state of the LangGraph agent.
If you are going to specify a type, you should be very careful that the type has the same shape as the state of your LangGraph agent.

It is not recommended, but you can ditch the type parameter and instead get an `any` type.
</Callout>

In this example, we use the `useCoAgent` hook to wire up the application's state to the LangGraph agent's state.
- For the generic type, we pass the `AgentState` type that was already defined for the application in `@/lib/types.ts`.
- For the `name` parameter, we pass the name of the graph as defined in `agent/langgraph.json`.
- For the `initialState` parameter, we pass the initial state of the LangGraph agent which is already defined in `@/lib/trips.ts`.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Try it out!

Now, try it out! Ask the Copilot something about the state of your trips. For example:

```
What trips do I currently have?
```

The state is shared between the application and the agent, so you can edit a trip manually, ask the same question,
and the agent will know about it.

```
What trips do I have now?
```

In the same vein, you can ask the agent to update your trips and it will render in the UI. For example:

```
Add some hotels to my NYC trip
```

Its really that simple, you have now integrated a LangGraph agent into the application as an agentic copilot. In the following 
steps, we'll be improving the user experience but the core agent is now accessible through the application's chat interface.
