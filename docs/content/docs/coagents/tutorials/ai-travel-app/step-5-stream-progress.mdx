title: "Step 5: Stream Progress"
---

Now that we have integrated the LangGraph agent into the application, we can start utilizing features that will enhance the
user agentic experience even further. For example, what if we could stream the progress of a search to the user?

In this step, we'll be doing just that. To do so we'll be using the `copilotkit_emit_state` CopilotKit SDK function in the
`search_node` of our LangGraph agent.

## Install the CopilotKit SDK

CopilotKit comes ready with an SDK for building both Python and Typescript agents. In this case, the agent is written in Python
(manged with `poetry`), so we'll be installing the Python SDK.

<Callout>
Don't have poetry installed? [Install it here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
</Callout>

```shell title="agent/"
poetry add copilotkit
```

Now we're ready to use the CopilotKit SDK in our agent! Since we're editing the `search_node` in agent, we'll be
editing the `search.py` file.

## Manually emitting the agent's state

With CoAgents, the LangGraph agent's state is only emitted when node change occurs (i.e, an edge is traversed). This means
that in-progress work is not emitted to the user by default. However, we can manually emit the state using the `copilotkit_emit_state`
function that we mentioned earlier.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add the custom CopilotKit config to the `search_node`
First, we're going to add a custom copilotkit config to the `search_node` to describe what intermediate state
we'll be emitting.

```python title="agent/travel/search.py" {3-5}
# ...
from copilotkit.langchain import copilotkit_emit_state, copilotkit_customize_config # [!code ++]

async def search_node(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
    """
    The search node is responsible for searching the for places.
    """
    ai_message = cast(AIMessage, state["messages"][-1])

    # [!code ++:9]
    config = copilotkit_customize_config(
        config,
        emit_intermediate_state=[{
            "state_key": "search_progress",
            "tool": "search_for_places",
            "tool_argument": "search_progress",
        }],
    )

    # ...
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Emit the intermediate state
Now we can call `copilotkit_emit_state` to emit the intermediate state wherever we want. In this case, we'll be emitting it
progress at the beginning of our search and as we receive results.

<Callout>
One piece of this that has already been setup for you is the `search_progress` state key. In order to emit progress, we add
an object to our state that we'll manually update with the results and progress of our search. Then we'll be calling `copilotkit_emit_state`
to manually emit that state.
</Callout>

```python title="agent/travel/search.py"
# ...
async def search_node(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
    """
    The search node is responsible for searching the for places.
    """
    ai_message = cast(AIMessage, state["messages"][-1])

    config = copilotkit_customize_config(
        config,
        emit_intermediate_state=[{
            "state_key": "search_progress",
            "tool": "search_for_places",
            "tool_argument": "search_progress",
        }],
    )

    # ^ Previous code

    state["search_progress"] = state.get("search_progress", [])
    queries = ai_message.tool_calls[0]["args"]["queries"]

    for query in queries:
        state["search_progress"].append({
            "query": query,
            "results": [],
            "done": False
        })

    await copilotkit_emit_state(config, state) # [!code ++]

    # ...
```

Now the state of our search will be emitted through the `search_progress` state key to CopilotKit! However, we still need to update this
state as we receive results from our search.

```python title="agent/travel/search.py"
# ...
async def search_node(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
    """
    The search node is responsible for searching the for places.
    """
    ai_message = cast(AIMessage, state["messages"][-1])
  
    config = copilotkit_customize_config(
        config,
        emit_intermediate_state=[{
            "state_key": "search_progress",
            "tool": "search_for_places",
            "tool_argument": "search_progress",
        }],
    )
  
    state["search_progress"] = state.get("search_progress", [])
    queries = ai_message.tool_calls[0]["args"]["queries"]
  
    for query in queries:
        state["search_progress"].append({
            "query": query,
            "results": [],
            "done": False
        })
  
    await copilotkit_emit_state(config, state) 

    # ^ Previous code

    places = []
    for i, query in enumerate(queries):
        response = gmaps.places(query)
        for result in response.get("results", []):
            place = {
                "id": result.get("place_id", f"{result.get('name', '')}-{i}"),
                "name": result.get("name", ""),
                "address": result.get("formatted_address", ""),
                "latitude": result.get("geometry", {}).get("location", {}).get("lat", 0),
                "longitude": result.get("geometry", {}).get("location", {}).get("lng", 0),
                "rating": result.get("rating", 0),
            }
            places.append(place)
        state["search_progress"][i]["done"] = True
        await copilotkit_emit_state(config, state) # [!code ++]

    state["search_progress"] = []
    await copilotkit_emit_state(config, state) # [!code ++]

    # ...

```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Recieving and rendering the manaully emitted state

Now that we are manually emitting the state of our search, we can recieve and render that state in the UI. To do this, 
we'll be using the [useCoAgentStateRender](/reference/hooks/useCoAgentStateRender) function in our `use-trips.tsx` hook.


All we need to do is tell CopilotKit to conditionally render the `search_progress` state key through the `useCoAgentStateRender` hook.

```tsx title="ui/lib/hooks/use-trips.tsx"
// ...
import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code --] 
import { useCoAgent, useCoAgentStateRender } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code ++]
import { SearchProgress } from "@/components/SearchProgress"; // [!code ++]

export const TripsProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  // ...

  // [!code ++:10]
  useCoAgentStateRender<AgentState>({
    name: "travel",
    render: ({ state }) => {
      if (state.search_progress) {
        return <SearchProgress progress={state.search_progress} />
      }
      return null;
    },
  });

  // ...
}

```

The `<SearchProgress />` component is a custom component that was created for you ahead of time. If you'd like to
learn more about it feel free to check it out in `ui/components/SearchProgress.tsx`!

<Callout>
One other thing done for you ahead of time is that the `search_progress` key is already present in the `AgentState` type. You
can look at that type in `ui/lib/types.ts`.
</Callout>

Give it a try! Ask the agent to search for places and we'll see the progress of each search as it comes in. 

The final step is to add human in the loop to the application to allow the user to approve or reject mutative actions the 
agent wants to perform.
