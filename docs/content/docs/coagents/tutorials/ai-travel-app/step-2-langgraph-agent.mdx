Before we start integrating the LangGraph agent, let's understand how it works. 

For the sake of this tutorial we won't be building the LangGraph together from scratch. 
Instead, we'll be using the LangGraph constructed in the `agent/` directory.

Let's walk through the LangGraph agent to understand how it works before we integrate it into the application.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Install LangGraph Studio

LangGraph Studio is a tool for visualizing and debugging LangGraph workflows. It is not required for using CopilotKit but it is highly recommended
for understanding how LangGraph works. 

To install LangGraph Studio, checkout the [setup guide](https://studio.langchain.com/).

</Step>
<Step>
### Retreive API keys

For this application, we'll need two API keys:
- OpenAI API key: You can get an API key from the OpenAI console [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
- Google Maps API key: This can be retrieved from the Google Cloud Console [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/get-api-key#creating-api-keys).

</Step>
<Step>
### Setup the .env file

In a new terminal, navigate to the agent directory.

```shell
cd examples/coagents-travel/agent
```

Now create a .env file there.

```shell
touch .env
```

With that created, we'll want to add your OPENAI_API_KEY and GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY to the file.

```txt title=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<your-google-maps-api-key>
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Visualizing the LangGraph Agent

With LangGraph Studio installed, you can run and visualize the LangGraph agent by opening the `examples/coagents-travel/agent/` directory in the studio.

The agent will take some time to load as things get setup but once finished it will look something like this.

### Understanding the LangGraph Agent

As we're building this agent into an agentic experience, we'll want to understand how it works. The key concepts at play here are:

- **State**: The state is the data that the agent is using to make and communicate its decisions. You can see all of the state variables in the bottom left of the screen.
- **Nodes**: Nodes are the building blocks of a LangGraph agent. They are the steps that the agent will take to complete a task. In this case, we have nodes for **chatting**, **searching** and **performing operations** on trips.
- **Edges**: Edges are the arrows that connect nodes together. They define the logic for how the agent will move from one node to the next. They are defined in code and conditional logic is handled with a `route` function.
- **Interrupts**: Interrupts are a way to allow for a user to work along side the agent and review its decisions. In this case, we have an **interrupt** before the **trips_node** which blocks the agent from proceeding until the user has approved the Agent's actions.

</Step>
<Step>
### Testing the LangGraph Agent

You can submit a message to the agent by adding a message to the `messages` state variable and then clicking "Submit".

You'll see the agent respond in the chat and direct appropriately through the various nodes. In this case, you should notice that the
agent calls the `search_node` and, once it has received a response, will add a new trip based on its findings to the state via the 
`trips_node`.

</Step>
<Step>
### Understanding breakpoints
A very important concept for agentic copilots is [human-in-the-loop](/coagents/concepts/human-in-the-loop). This is the idea that the agent should be able to pause and wait for a human to review and approve its decisions.
LangGraph allows for this by using **breakpoints**. Let's take a look at what that looks like in action.

First, click on the `trips_node` and select the `interrupt_after` option.

Now, try to have the agent create a new trip again. You'll notice that it now asks for approval before proceeding via a `continue` button.

Make sure to remove the `interrupt_after` option before proceeding, this will break things later if you don't.

</Step>
<Step>
### Leave LangGraph Studio running

In order to create an agentic copilot, you'll need to have your LangGraph agent running somewhere. In our case, LangGraph studio is 
running this locally for us. We can see this by looking at the URL at the bottom left of the application.

![LangGraph Studio URL](/images/coagents/tutorials/ai-travel-app/lgs-url.png)

Later in this tutorial, we'll be using this URL to connect CopilotKit to the LangGraph agent.

</Step>
</Steps>
Here's what we did:
- Installed LangGraph Studio
- Setup the .env file
- Visualized the LangGraph agent
- Tested the LangGraph agent
- Left LangGraph Studio running

In the next step, we'll be integrating the LangGraph agent into the application as an agentic copilot.
