CoAgents support Human-in-the-loop workflows where human input or validation is required during agent execution. 
This is a dance between the LangGraph agent and the UI, but is also a fundamental concept for agentic applications. If you
want to learn more about theory behind human-in-the-loop checkout [LangGraph's article on it](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/)

## Why Use Human-in-the-loop?
Human-in-the-loop capabilities are essential for several reasons:
- **Quality Control**: Enables oversight at critical decision points, ensuring AI actions align with business requirements and user expectations
- **Edge Case Handling**: Provides graceful handling of situations where AI confidence is low
- **Expert Integration**: Leverages human expertise where it's most valuable
- **System Reliability**: Creates a more robust and trustworthy system for complex real-world scenarios

## Implementation with Copilotkit
With Copilotkit you can accomplish this Human-in-the-loop interaction with custom components that approve, deny or amend
any actions the agent would like to perform. In practice, you can do this at an app level or a chat level using various
pieces of Copilotkit's packages. Checkout out guides on both below:

- [In-app workflows](/coagents/react-ui/frontend-functions)
