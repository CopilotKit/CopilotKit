CoAgents support Human-in-the-loop workflows where human input or validation is required during agent execution. 
This is a dance between the LangGraph agent and the UI, but why is it something you should invest 
time into implementing?

Human-in-the-loop capabilities are essential for several reasons. First, they allow for quality control and oversight
in critical decision points, ensuring that AI actions align with business requirements and user expectations. 
Additionally, HITL workflows enable graceful handling of edge cases where AI confidence is low or where human expertise
is particularly valuable. This approach creates a more robust and trustworthy system that can handle complex real-world
scenarios while maintaining high standards of accuracy and reliability.

With Copilotkit you can accomplish this Human-in-the-loop interaction with custom components that approve, deny or amend
any actions the agent would like to perform. To read more, checkout our in-depth guide here.
