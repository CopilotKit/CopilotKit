CoAgents is Copilotkit's integration layer for agent frameworks, with first-class support for LangGraph. Co-agents
are AI agents designed to collaborate with users in Agent-Native applications, rather than operate autonomously, and
CopilotKit's CoAgents provides the UX infrastructure to transform LangGraph-based agents into interactive co-agents.

The core CopilotKit runloop is itself an example of a [ReAct agent](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-s-a-react-agent-5hu7ZOaKSAuY7YdFjQLCNQ)
which is designed to be very simple to implement. You should use CoAgents when you require tight control over
your agent's behavior, of the kind offered by an Agentic Orchestration framework. Today we offer [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)
as our framework of choice. An excellent example of the type of experiences you can accomplish with CoAgent
applications can be found in our [Research Canvas](/examples/coagents-research-canvas). More specifically, it
demonstrates how CoAgents allow for AI driven experiences with:
- Precise state management across agent interactions
- Sophisticated multi-step reasoning capabilities
- Seamless orchestration of multiple AI tools
- Interactive human-AI collaboration features
- Real-time state updates and progress streaming

All of these features are essential to delight instead of frustrate your users with AI features. In the following
sections we'll go over how CoAgents tackle each of these concepts as well as how you can get started utilizing
them in a matter of hours and not months.
