        CoAgents are Copilotkit's integration layer for agent frameworks, with first-class support for LangGraph. Co-agents
        are AI agents designed to collaborate with users in Agent-Native applications, rather than operate autonomously, and
        CopilotKit's CoAgents provides the UX infrastructure to transform LangGraph-based agents into interactive co-agents.

        The core CopilotKit runloop is itself an example of a [ReAct agent](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-s-a-react-agent-5hu7ZOaKSAuY7YdFjQLCNQ)
        which is designed to be very simple to implement. You should use CoAgents when you require tight control over
        your agent's behavior, of the kind offered by an Agentic Orchestration framework. Today we offer [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/)
        as our framework of choice. An excellent example of the type of experiences you can accomplish with CoAgent
        applications can be found in our [Research Canvas](/examples/coagents-research-canvas). More specifically, it
        demonstrates how CoAgents allow for AI driven experiences with:
        - Precise state management across agent interactions
        - Sophisticated multi-step reasoning capabilities
        - Seamless orchestration of multiple AI tools
        - Interactive human-AI collaboration features
        - Real-time state updates and progress streaming

        All of these features are essential to delight instead of frustrate your users with AI features. In the following
        sections we'll go over how CoAgents tackle each of these concepts as well as how you can get started utilizing
        them in a matter of hours and not months.

        LangGraph is a powerful framework for building agentic applications, but it requires a lot of additional
        infrastructure to build out a full-stack application. CoAgents are designed to be used in conjunction with LangGraph,
        not be replacement for LangGraph. Any LangGraph-based agent can be transformed into a CoAgent with a minimal amount
        of effort to get industry leading agnetic UX such as:
        - Human-in-the-loop collaboration
        - Agent and UI shared state
        - Intermediate result and progress streaming
        - Full agentic control through the UI

        Checkout our [getting started guide](/coagents/getting-started) to learn more about turning your LangGraph into an agentic experience.
