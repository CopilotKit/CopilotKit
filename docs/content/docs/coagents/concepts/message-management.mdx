title: Message Management
---

Message management in CoAgents operates with CopilotKit as the "ground truth" for the full chat session. 
When a co-agent session begins, it receives the existing CopilotKit chat history to maintain conversational
continuity across different agents.

While all of this information is great to know, in most cases you won't need to worry about these details to
build rich agentic applications. Use the information here as a reference when getting really deep into 
the CoAgent internals.

## Types of LLM Messages

Modern LLM interactions produce two distinct types of messages:

1. **Communication Messages**: Direct responses and interactions with users
2. **Internal Messages**: Agent "thoughts" and reasoning processes

For example, while OpenAI's o1 model has sophisticated reasoning capabilities and thoughts, its internal
thought processes are typically hidden to maintain clean communication. LangGraph's default operates similarly
and its behavior is to omit these internal messages from user-facing chat history.

However, Copilotkit allows you to configure manually emit messages from LangGraph to be added into CopilotKit's
chat history.

```python
async def ask_name_node(state: GreetAgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
    """
    Ask the user for their name.
    """
 
    await copilotkit_emit_message(config, "Hey, what is your name? 🙂")
 
    return {
        "messages": state["messages"],
    }
```

## Message Flow
Messages flow between CopilotKit and LangGraph in a specific way:

- User-facing (streamed) messages from LangGraph are forwarded to CopilotKit
- Internal agent messages remain within LangGraph (omitted from the user-facing chat history)
- All CopilotKit messages are preserved to maintain consistency 
- On the next agent invocation, the full CopilotKit chat history is provided to the LangGraph agent

When a co-agent completes its execution, its relevant messages become part of CopilotKit's persistent chat
history. 

### That's a bit unintuitive, why do CoAgents act this way?

CoAgents are designed to operate as a single conversation, however, it also allows for multi-agent interactions. By adding
messages from LangGraph to CopilotKit's chat history, we ensure that the entire conversation is captured and can be
accessed by the next agent in the sequence.

### Can I modify the message history?

You can modify the message history by updating CopilotKit's ground truth messages using the `useCopilotChat` hook's
`setMessages` method. If you'd like more understanding on how to use this hook, checkout out 
[reference documentation](/reference/hooks/useCopilotChat).
