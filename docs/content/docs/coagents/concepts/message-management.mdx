title: Message Management
---

Message management in CoAgents operates with CopilotKit as the "ground truth" for the full chat session. 
When an CoAgent session begins, it receives the existing CopilotKit chat history to maintain conversational
continuity across different agents.

### Can I modify the message history?

You can modify the message history by updating CopilotKit's messages using the `useCopilotChat` hook's
`setMessages` method. If you'd like more understanding on how to use this hook, checkout out 
[reference documentation](/reference/hooks/useCopilotChat).

If you'd like to learn more about how to save and restore message history, check out our guide on [saving and restoring messages](/guides/messages-localstorage).

While all of this information is great to know, in most cases you won't need to worry about these details to
build rich agentic applications. Use the information here as a reference when getting really deep into 
the CoAgent internals.

## Types of LLM Messages

Modern LLM interactions produce two distinct types of messages:

1. **Communication Messages**: Direct responses and interactions with users
2. **Internal Messages**: Agent "thoughts" and reasoning processes

A well known example of this pattern is OpenAI's o1 model, which has sophisticated reasoning capabilities and thoughts. Its internal
thought processes are presented distictly from 'communication messages' which are clearly visible to the end-user.

LangGraph agents can operate similarly. An LLM call's output can be considered either a communication message, or an internal message.

However, Copilotkit allows you to configure manually emit messages from LangGraph to be added into CopilotKit's
chat history.

```python
async def ask_name_node(state: GreetAgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
    """
    Ask the user for their name.
    """
 
    await copilotkit_emit_message(config, "Hey, what is your name? ðŸ™‚")
 
    return {
        "messages": state["messages"],
    }
```

## Message Flow
Messages flow between CopilotKit and LangGraph in a specific way:

- User-facing (emitted) messages from LangGraph are forwarded to CopilotKit
- Internal agent messages remain within LangGraph (omitted from the user-facing chat history)
- On a fresh agent invocation, the full CopilotKit chat history is provided to the LangGraph agent as its pre-existing chat history.

When an CoAgent completes its execution, its relevant messages become part of CopilotKit's persistent chat
history.
