title: Message Management
---

Message management in CoAgents operates with CopilotKit as the "ground truth" for the full chat session. 
When a co-agent session begins, it receives the existing CopilotKit chat history to maintain conversational
continuity across different agents.

Messages flow between CopilotKit and LangGraph in a specific way:

- User-facing (streamed) messages from LangGraph are forwarded to CopilotKit
- Internal agent messages remain within LangGraph
- All CopilotKit messages are preserved to maintain consistency

When a co-agent completes its execution, its relevant messages become part of CopilotKit's persistent chat
history. This means subsequent agents will have access to these messages as context for their own execution.
To modify this history, developers must update CopilotKit's ground truth messages using the `useCopilotChat`
hook's `setMessages` method.
