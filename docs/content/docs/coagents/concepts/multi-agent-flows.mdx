When building agentic applications, you often want to orchestrate complex flows together that require the coordination of multiple
agents. This is traditionally called multi-agent orchestration, and CoAgents come with built-in support for it. Copilotkit supports
two modes for multi-agent flows:

- **Router Mode**: Allow an LLM to intelligently route requests to the appropriate agent.
- **Agent Mode**: Have a single agent that is responsible for everything.

For more information about how to configure your Agentic Copilot to use these modes, check out our [guide](/coagents/advanced/router-mode-agent-lock).
