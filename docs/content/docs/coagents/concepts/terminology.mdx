title: Terminology
---

Here are the key terms and concepts used throughout CoAgents:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Agentic Copilot | An AI agent designed to collaborate with users in Agent-Native applications, rather than operate autonomously. |
| CoAgent | Terminology referring to CopilotKit's suite of tools for building agentic applications. Typically interchangeable with agentic copilot. |
| Agent State | The current data and context maintained by a LangGraph agent during its execution, including both internal state and data that can be synchronized with the frontend UI. |
| Agentic Generative UI | UI components that are dynamically generated and updated based on the agent's current state, providing users with visibility into what the agent is doing and building trust through transparency. |
| Ground Truth | In CoAgents, CopilotKit serves as the "ground truth" for the full chat session, maintaining the persistent chat history and ensuring conversational continuity across different agents. |
| Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) | A workflow pattern where human input or validation is required during agent execution, enabling quality control and oversight at critical decision points. |
| Intermediate State | The updates to agent state that occur during node execution, rather than only at node transitions, enabling real-time feedback about the agent's progress. |
| [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) | The agent framework integrated with CopilotKit that provides the orchestration layer for CoAgents, enabling sophisticated multi-step reasoning and state management. |
| Agent Lock Mode | A mode where CopilotKit is configured to work exclusively with a specific agent, ensuring all requests stay within a single workflow graph for precise control. |
| Router Mode | A mode where CopilotKit dynamically routes requests between different agents and tools based on context and user input, enabling flexible multi-agent workflows. |
| State Streaming | The real-time synchronization of agent state between the backend and frontend, enabling immediate updates to the UI as the agent performs tasks. |

These terms are referenced throughout the documentation and are essential for understanding how CoAgents work and how to implement them effectively in your applications.
