## Background

<u>**Agentic generative UI**</u> is generative UI that is based on the **agent's
current state**. I.e. you can render to the user what the agent is currently doing
in the chat UI. Continuously rendering the agent's state is the gold standard for
agentic UX; it keeps users **engaged** and **builds trust** by demonstrating that
the agent is on the right track.

(See also [`useCopilotAction` for non-agentic generative UI](/guides/generative-ui).)

<Callout type="info">
  By default, the LangGraph agent state updates only **between** LangGraph node transitions. However, for a more engaging user experience, you'll likely want to render the state as it updates **continuously**.

To learn how to stream and render intermediate agent states, providing real-time updates to your users, refer to our guide on [Streaming Intermediate State](/coagents/advanced/intermediate-state-streaming).

## Rendering Agent State with `useCoAgentStateRender`

To render state in your application, use the `useCoAgentStateRender` hook. Here's a simple example using untyped objects:

```tsx
"use client"; // only necessary if you are using Next.js with the App Router. // [!code highlight]

import { useCoagentStateRender } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

useCoagentStateRender({
  // [!code highlight:11]
  name: "basic_agent", // the name of the agent
  nodeName: "optionally_specifiy_a_specifc_node", // Optional! You can specify a specific node you want generative UI for. Omit this argument if you want to render the agent's state for any node.
  render: ({ status, state, nodeName }) => {
    return (
      <WeatherDisplay
        conditions={state.final_response.conditions}
        temperature={state.final_response.temperature}
      />
    );
  },
});
```

The render function can return any valid React node; you can use your own components to display the agent's state.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT! Stream & render the intermediate agent state

By default, the LangGraph agent state will only update _between_ LangGraph node transitions --
which means state updates will be discontinuous and delayed.

You likely want to render the agent state as it updates **continuously.** See **[stream intermediate state](/coagents/advanced/intermediate-state-streaming).**

## Developer experience: using typed state with generics

To get better type safety and IntelliSense support, you can provide TypeScript types to `useCoAgentStateRender`.

Define your agent's state types:

<Tabs items={["TypeScript", "Python (Pydantic)"]}>
  <Tab value="TypeScript">

```ts
type WeatherResponse = {
  conditions: string;
  temperature: number;
  wind_direction: string;
  wind_speed: number;
};

type AgentState = {
  final_response: WeatherResponse;
  input: string;
  messages: any[];
};
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Python (Pydantic)">
  In your LangGraph Python code:
  
  ```python
  class WeatherResponse(BaseModel):
      conditions: str = Field(description="Weather conditions in the location")
      temperature: float = Field(description="The temperature in fahrenheit")
      wind_direction: str = Field(description="The direction of the wind in abbreviated form")
      wind_speed: float = Field(description="The speed of the wind in km/h")

class AgentState(MessagesState):
final_response: WeatherResponse
input: str

````

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Now, you can use generics with `useCoAgentStateRender`:

```tsx
"use client"; // only necessary if you are using Next.js with the App Router. // [!code highlight]

import { useCoagentStateRender } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

useCoagentStateRender<AgentState>({ // [!code highlight:9]
name: "basic_agent", // the name of the agent
nodeName: "optionally_specifiy_a_specifc_node", // Optional! You can specify a specific node you want generative UI for. Omit this argument if you want to render the agent's state for any node.
render: ({ status, state, nodeName }) => {
  return (
    <DetailedWeatherInfo data={state.final_response} />
  );
},
});
````

This way, you'll get type checking and auto-completion for `state` properties.

In this example, `DetailedWeatherInfo` is a component you define to display detailed weather information using the typed state.
