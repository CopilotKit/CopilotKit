title: Agentic Generative UI
description: Utilize agentic generative UI to render the current agent state in your application
---

One of the benefits of LangGraph is that the agent is stateful. This enables interesting and complex agentic experiences. With CopilotKit, you can utilize what we refer to as 
<u>**Agentic Generative UI**</u> to render that state. 

More specifically, the `useCoAgentStateRender` hook allows you to render UI components or text based on a CoAgent's state.

<Callout>
Also see [`useCopilotAction` for non-agentic generative UI](/guides/generative-ui).

Before getting started, you'll want to make sure you've gone through the [quickstart guide](/coagents/quickstart). This will make sure you have setup everything on your side to connect your LangGraph
agent to CopilotKit.

## Utilizing `useCoAgentStateRender`

To render state in your application, use the `useCoAgentStateRender` hook. As previously mentioned, it will allow you to render UI components or text based on a CoAgent's state. Here's a simple example using untyped objects:

```tsx
"use client"; // only necessary if you are using Next.js with the App Router. // [!code highlight]

import { useCoAgentStateRender } from "@copilotkit/react-core";

useCoAgentStateRender<YourAgentState>({ // The generic parameter (`YourAgentState`) can be omitted as well // [!code highlight:12]
  name: "basic_agent", // the name of the agent
  nodeName: "optionally_specify_a_specific_node", // Optional! You can specify a specific node you want generative UI for. Omit this argument if you want to render the agent's state for any node.
  render: ({ status, state, nodeName }) => {
    return (
      <WeatherDisplay
        conditions={state.final_response.conditions}
        temperature={state.final_response.temperature}
      />
    );
  },
});
```

The render function can return any valid React node; you can use your own components to display the agent's state.

It provides the `status`, `nodeName`, and current `state` parameters to the render function which are representative of the agent's state. As the input state changes, it will stream 
into the render function and renders will trigger automatically.

## Developer experience: using typed state with generics

To get better type safety and IntelliSense support, you can provide TypeScript types to `useCoAgentStateRender`.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Define your agent's state types
This is likely already defined in your LangGraph codebase, but for the sake of this guide, we'll define it here.

In the LangGraph codebase, define the state types like so:

<Tabs groupId="language" items={["TypeScript", "Python (Pydantic)"]}>
  <Tab value="TypeScript">
      ```ts title="state.ts"
      type WeatherResponse = {
        conditions: string;
        temperature: number;
        wind_direction: string;
        wind_speed: number;
      };

      type AgentState = {
        final_response: WeatherResponse;
        input: string;
        messages: any[];
      };
      ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Python (Pydantic)">
  ```python title="state.py"
  class WeatherResponse(BaseModel):
      conditions: str = Field(description="Weather conditions in the location")
      temperature: float = Field(description="The temperature in fahrenheit")
      wind_direction: str = Field(description="The direction of the wind in abbreviated form")
      wind_speed: float = Field(description="The speed of the wind in km/h")

  class AgentState(MessagesState):
    final_response: WeatherResponse
    input: str

```

</Tab>

</Tabs>
</Step>
<Step>
### Add your agent's state as a type in the UI
Our type is defined in the agent, but we will need to add it to the UI as well. **It is highly encouraged that these types match, otherwise you may run hard-to-catch issues.**

```tsx title="types.ts"
type WeatherResponse = {
  conditions: string;
  temperature: number;
  wind_direction: string;
  wind_speed: number;
};

type AgentState = {
  final_response: WeatherResponse;
  input: string;
  messages: any[];
};
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Use generics with `useCoAgentStateRender`:

Now we're ready to use the `useCoAgentStateRender` hook with our typed state.

<Callout>
In this example, `DetailedWeatherInfo` is an undefined component that would display detailed weather information using the typed state.
</Callout>

```tsx title="App.tsx"
"use client"; // only necessary if you are using Next.js with the App Router. // [!code highlight]

import { useCoAgentStateRender } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
import { AgentState } from "./types";

useCoAgentStateRender<AgentState>({ // [!code highlight:9]
    name: "basic_agent", // the name of the agent
    nodeName: "optionally_specify_a_specific_node", // Optional! You can specify a specific node you want generative UI for. Omit this argument if you want to render the agent's state for any node.
    render: ({ status, state, nodeName }) => {
      return (
        <DetailedWeatherInfo data={state.final_response} />
      );
    },
});
```

</Step>
</Steps>

With this complete, you'll get type checking and auto-completion for `state` properties. 

## Streaming intermediate agent state

By default, the LangGraph agent state will only update _between_ LangGraph node transitions -- which means state updates will be discontinuous and delayed. It is very likely you'll want to render the agent state as it updates **continuously.**

See our **[emit intermediate state](/coagents/advanced/intermediate-state-streaming)** guide for how to do this.

## Example

See the [Research Canvas example](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/examples/coagents-research-canvas) for a real-world of `useCoAgentStateRender`.
