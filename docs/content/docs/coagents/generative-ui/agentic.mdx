## What is this?

All LangGraph agents are stateful. This means that as your agent progresses through nodes, a state object is passed between them perserving
the overall state of a session. CopilotKit allows you to render this state in your application with custom UI components, which we call **Agentic Generative UI**.

## When should I use this?

Rendering the state of your agent in the UI is useful when you want to provide the user with feedback about the overall state of a session. A great example of this
is a situation where a user and an agent are working together to solve a problem. The agent can store a draft in its state which is then rendered in the UI.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Run and Connect your LangGraph to CopilotKit
    First, you'll need to make sure you have a running LangGraph. If you haven't already done this, you can follow the [getting started guide](/coagents/quickstart/langgraph)

    This guide uses the [CoAgents starter repo](https://github.com/CopilotKit/coagents-starter) as its starting point.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Define your agent state
    If you're not familiar with LangGraph, your graphs are stateful. As you progress through nodes, a state object is passed between them. CopilotKit
    allows you to easily render this state in your application. 
    
    For the sake of this guide, let's say our state looks like this in our agent.

    <Tabs groupId="language" items={['Python', 'TypeScript']} default="Python">
        <Tab value="Python">
          ```python title="agent/sample_agent/agent.py"
          # ...
          from copilotkit import CopilotKitState # extends MessagesState
          # ...

          # This is the state of the agent.
          # It inherits from the CopilotKitState properties from CopilotKit.
          class AgentState(CopilotKitState):
              searches: list[dict]
          ```
        </Tab>
        <Tab value="TypeScript">
          ```typescript title="agent/sample_agent/agent.ts"
          // ...
          import { Annotation } from "@langchain/langgraph";
          import { CopilotKitStateAnnotation } from "@copilotkit/sdk-js/langgraph";
          // ...

          // This is the state of the agent.
          // It inherits from the CopilotKitState properties from CopilotKit.
          export const AgentStateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
            searches: Annotation<object[]>,
            ...CopilotKitStateAnnotation.spec,
          });
          ```
        </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Render state of the agent in the chat
    Now we can utilize `useCoAgentStateRender` to render the state of our agent **in the chat**.

    ```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
    // ...
    import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
    // ...

    // Define the state of the agent, should match the state of the agent in your LangGraph.
    type AgentState = {
      searches: {
        query: string;
        done: boolean;
      }[];
    };

    function YourMainContent() {
      // ... 

      // [!code highlight:14]
      // styles omitted for brevity
      useCoAgentStateRender<AgentState>({
        name: "sample_agent", // the name the agent is served as
        render: ({ state }) => (
          <div>
            {state.searches?.map((search, index) => (
              <div key={index}>
                {search.done ? "✅" : "❌"} {search.query}{search.done ? "" : "..."}
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
        ),
      });

      // ...

      return <div>...</div>;
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Render state outside of the chat
    You can also render the state of your agent **outside of the chat**. This is useful when you want to render the state of your agent anywhere
    other than the chat.

    ```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
    import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]
    // ...

    // Define the state of the agent, should match the state of the agent in your LangGraph.
    type AgentState = {
      searches: {
        query: string;
        done: boolean;
      }[];
    };

    function YourMainContent() {
      // ... 

      // [!code highlight:5]
      const { state } = useCoAgent<AgentState>({
        name: "sample_agent", // the name the agent is served as
      })

      // ...

      return (
        <div>
          {/* ... */}
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-2 mt-4">
            // [!code highlight:6]
            {state.searches?.map((search, index) => (
              <div key={index} className="flex flex-row">
                {search.done ? "✅" : "❌"} {search.query}
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
        </div>
      )
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Give it a try!

    You've now created a component that will render the agent's state in the chat.
