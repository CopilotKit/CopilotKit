## What is Generative UI?

Generative UI lets you render your agent's state, progress, outputs, and tool calls with custom UI components in real-time. It bridges the gap between AI
agents and user interfaces. As your agent processes information and makes decisions, you can render custom UI components that:

- Show loading states and progress indicators
- Display structured data in tables, cards, or charts
- Create interactive elements for user input
- Animate transitions between different states

## How can I use this?

There are two main variants of Generative UI.

<CTACards
  columns={2}
  cards={[
    {
      icon: BotIcon,
      title: "Agentic",
      description: "Render your agent's state, progress, and outputs with custom UI components.",
      href: "/coagents/generative-ui/agentic"
    },
    {
      icon: WrenchIcon,
      title: "Tool-based",
      description: "Render your agent's tool calls with custom UI components.",
      href: "/coagents/generative-ui/tool-based"
    },
  ]}
/>
