## What is this?

Tools are a way for the LLM to call predefined, typically, deterministic functions. CopilotKit allows you to render these tools in the UI
as a custom component, which we call **Generative UI**.

## When should I use this?

Rendering tools in the UI is useful when you want to provide the user with feedback about what your agent is doing, specifically
when your agent is calling tools. CopilotKit allows you to fully customize how these tools are rendered in the chat.

    <Tab value="Python">
        ```python title="agent/sample_agent/agent.py"
        from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
        from langchain.tools import tool
        # ...

        # [!code highlight:7]
        @tool
        def get_weather(location: str):
            """
            Get the weather for a given location.
            """
            return f"The weather for {location} is 70 degrees."

        # ...

        def chat_node(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
            model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
            model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather]) # [!code highlight]

            response = await model_with_tools.ainvoke([
                SystemMessage(content=f"You are a helpful assistant.")
                *state["messages"],
            ], config)

            # ...
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
</Step>
<Step>
### Render the tool call in your frontend
At this point, your agent will be able to call the `get_weather` tool. Now 
we just need to add a `useCopilotAction` hook to render the tool call in
the UI.

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { useLangGraphInterrupt } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]
// ...

const YourMainContent = () => {
  // ...
  // [!code highlight:13]
  useCopilotAction({
    name: "get_weather",
    // Don't allow the agent or UI to call this tool, its only for rendering
    available: "disabled",
    render: ({status, args}) => {
      return (
        <p className="text-gray-500 mt-2">
          {status !== "complete" && "Calling weather API..."}
          {status === "complete" && `Called the weather API for ${args.location}.`}
        </p>
      );
    },
  });
  // ...
}
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Give it a try!

Try asking the agent to get the weather for a location. You should see the custom UI component that we added
render the tool call and display the arguments that were passed to the tool.
