This is a demo of a Perplexity-style search engine using **CopilotKit and LangGraph**.
Combining these technologies enables agentic copilots or, put short, **CoAgents**, which allow for the creation of human in the loop AI agents.
Instead of relying entirely on AI, CoAgents let users step in to guide or adjust the search as needed.

In this demo, the CoAgent will come up with a list of topics to research, and combine the results
into a comprehensive answer, including references to the sources used.

The agent state is streamed live to the frontend, so that the user can see the work progressing.

Both the LangGraph and the CopilotKit specific code for this demo is [available
on GitHub](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/tree/main/examples/coagents-ai-researcher).
