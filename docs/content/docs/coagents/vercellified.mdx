CopilotKit and LangGraph together provide everything you need to build rich, interactive, agent-powered applications. With full user-interaction infrastructure, you can create copilots that are not just smart, but truly collaborative.  This means that your agentic application can\:
* Respond quickly and often to user input
* Prompt the user for instructions as needed
* Take action on the user's behalf, driving the app, or other tools through MCP

## ✨ Key Feature: Generative UI

Generative UI lets you render your agent's state, progress, outputs, and tool calls with custom UI components in real-time. It bridges the gap between AI agents and user interfaces.

## 🧑‍💻 Key Feature: Human in the Loop

Empower users to guide agents at key checkpoints. Human-in-the-loop lets you combine the best of AI and human judgment.

## 🔄 Key Feature: Shared State

Keep your agent and your app in sync. Shared state means your agent can see everything in your app, and your app can react to your agent.

## Live Demo - LangGraph x CopilotKit in Action

In this example, we've built an agentic travel assistant that can you help you plan your next trip. It uses LangGraph
to coordinate chat and task execution.
