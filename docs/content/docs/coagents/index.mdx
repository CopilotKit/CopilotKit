## Build Agent-Native Applications with CoAgents



 A powerful new wave of Agent-Native Applications has emerged based on verticalized AI agents & agent-native UX (Replit Agent, v0, OpenAIâ€™s Canvas, etc). **CoAgents provides everything you need to deeply integrate LangGraph agents into react applications-
and build such Agent-Native applications.**




**See an introduction below:**

<div className="flex justify-center my-12">
  <YouTubeVideo videoId="tVjVYJE-Nic" defaultPlaybackRate={1.0} />
</div>

**We build this example step-by-step in this tutorial:**
<div className="flex justify-center my-12">
  <YouTubeVideo videoId="0b6BVqPwqA0" defaultPlaybackRate={1.0} />
</div>

### Key Features

- **__Shared State:__** Seamlessly synchronize state between agents and your application, enabling real-time interactions and updates. With a single line of code, your application can see everything the agent is doing, and the agent can see everything that happens inside the application.

- **__Agentic Generative UI:__** Create dynamic, AI-generated user interfaces that adapt to user needs and agent outputs. Unlike traditional generative UI, agentic generative UI is based on the agent's state, providing users with visibility into what the agent is doing and building trust.

- **__Stream Intermediate Agent State:__** Visualize agent thought processes in real-time, providing transparency and engaging user experiences. This is crucial for agent performance and for UX which matches user expectations.

- **__Human-in-the-Loop:__** Seamlessly integrate human oversight and intervention into your AI workflows for enhanced accuracy and control. Specify breakpoints in the agent process where human input or approval is required, allowing for greater safety and better agent performance.

- **__Realtime Frontend Actions:__** Provide your agent with frontend & backend actions available based on user context and current application state. These tool calls are automatically propagated as needed, with support for generative UI.

With CoAgents, you can harness the power of AI to create intelligent, responsive, and user-centric applications that push the boundaries of what's possible in software development.
