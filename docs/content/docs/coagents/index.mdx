# Copilot Infrastructure for LangGraph Agents

Full user-interaction infrastructure for your agents, to turn your agents into Copilot Agents (CoAgents).

## Common Questions

Have a question about CoAgents? You're in the right place!

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Can you explain what a CoAgent is in more detail?">
Sure! CoAgents are what we call "agentic copilots". Well, what's an agentic copilot then?

Think of a Copilot as a simple and fully LLM controlled assistant that has relatively limited capabilities. An Agentic Copilot then is a copilot
that has been enhanced with the ability to use LangGraph agents to perform more complex tasks. This is an extremely powerful way to build AI
powered applications because it gives you, the developer, the ability to control the agent's behavior in a deterministic way while still letting
the agent do its magic.

For more on this topic, checkout our [agentic copilot](/coagents/concepts/agentic-copilots) concept page.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I attach to an existing thread?">
Yes, check out our [Guide on Threads](/coagents/persistence/loading-message-history) for more information.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use CopilotKit without LangGraph?">

CopilotKit is a complete framework for building AI-powered applications and can be used standalone.

If you want to integrate with an agent framework, we currently support [LangGraph](/coagents/quickstart/langgraph) and [CrewAI](/crewai-flows/quickstart/crewai).

Checkout our [CopilotKit Overview](/) for more information!
