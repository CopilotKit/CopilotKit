# Build Next-Gen AI Apps with Agents

Unleash the power of **Agent-Native Applications**, the next evolution in AI, with CoAgents. Just like Replit Agent, v0, and OpenAI's Canvas, you can now create intelligent apps powered by LangGraph agents that think, adapt, and collaborate with users in real-time.

<Callout>

{" "}
<strong>CoAgents v0.3</strong> is now available! To start using it, update your
CopilotKit dependencies to the latest pre-release:

```package-install
npm install @copilotkit/react-ui@1.4.8-coagents-v0-3.1 @copilotkit/react-core@1.4.8-coagents-v0-3.1
```

Also, update your Python dependencies to this pre-release:

```bash
poetry add copilotkit==0.1.31a4 fastapi uvicorn
```

See the [Migration Guide](/coagents/troubleshooting/migrate-from-v0.2-to-v0.3) for details on how to migrate from v0.2 to v0.3.

## Common Questions

Have a question about CoAgents? You're in the right place!

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Can you explain what a CoAgent is in more detail?">
Sure! CoAgents are what we call "agentic copilots". Well, what's an agentic copilot then?

Think of a Copilot as a simple and fully LLM controlled assistant that has relatively limited capabilities. An Agentic Copilot then is a copilot
that has been enhanced with the ability to use LangGraph agents to perform more complex tasks. This is an extremely powerful way to build AI
powered applications because it gives you, the developer, the ability to control the agent's behavior in a deterministic way while still letting
the agent do its magic.

For more on this topic, checkout our [agentic copilot](/coagents/concepts/agentic-copilots) concept page.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I attach to an existing thread?">
Development of CoAgents is ongoing. One part of this is the ability to attach to an existing thread which is a high priority on our roadmap.

Stay tuned for updates!

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use CopilotKit without LangGraph?">
For CoAgents, the answer is no. LangGraph is the only supported agent framework for CoAgents.

However, if you are not looking to work with agents, CopilotKit is a complete framework for building AI-powered applications. LangGraph is just one tool of many that we integrate with to provide
rich AI experiences.
