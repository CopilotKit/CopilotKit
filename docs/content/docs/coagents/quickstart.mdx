## Before you start

CoAgents integrate with LangGraph-powered agents which are either deployed to the LangGraph Platform or self-hosted with a FastAPI endpoint.

The LangGraph Platform deployment is recommended and supports both LangGraph.js and LangGraph python.
Raw self-hosting is currently only offered via CopilotKit's FastAPI-powered remote-endpoint.

**This guide assumes youâ€™re familiar with using LangGraph to build agent workflows.** If you need a quick introduction,
check out [this brief example from the LangGraph docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).

## Getting started

### How are you deploying your agent?
In order for CopilotKit to integrate with your LangGraph agent, the agent has to be deployed: either via a LangGraph Platform Endpoint, or via a Copilot Remote Endpoint.

          </Accordion>
        </Accordions>

        With your LangGraph deployment URL, all that is left is to register our LangGraph agent to the Copilot Cloud runtime.

          </Step>
          <Step>
            ## Connect the app to the remote endpoint
            Once you've found your runtime instance, you can connect your app to the remote endpoint by modifying your CopilotRuntime configuration.

            ```tsx
              // ...
              import { langGraphPlatformEndpoint } from '@copilotkit/runtime'; // [!code highlight]

              const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
                // ...existing configuration
                remoteEndpoints: [
                  langGraphPlatformEndpoint({
                    deploymentUrl: "your-api-url", // make sure to replace with your real deployment url // [!code highlight]
                    langsmithApiKey: process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY, // only used in LangGraph Platform deployments
                    agents: [ // List any agents available under "graphs" list in your langgraph.json file; give each a description explaining when it should be called.
                      {
                        name: 'my_agent', // [!code highlight]
                        description: 'A helpful LLM agent.' // [!code highlight]
                        assistantId: 'your-assistant-ID' // optional, but recommended! // [!code highlight]
                      }
                    ]
                  }),
                ],
              });
            ```
            <Callout>
              The key names under `graphs` in the `langgraph.json` are the agent(s) name(s) unless you specified otherwise when creating your agents<br />
              Make sure these names are used whenever you have to use an agent name throughout the integration with CopilotKit<br/><br/>
              Additionally, you can specify assistant IDs, which is an optional, yet more accurate way to specify an agent
            </Callout>
            <Callout>
              Remember to replace `your-api-url` with your actual LangGraph Platform deployment URL and
              set your LangSmith API key as an environment variable.

    **For orientation, here's how CoAgents are wired:**
    <CoAgentsDiagram />

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        First, take a minute to **[go through the CopilotKit quickstart](/quickstart), and integrate CopilotKit into your React app.**
        This should only take a minute.

        <Callout type="info">
          Note! that if you are planning to use only a single LangGraph agent as your app's agentic backend,
          you can use Agent-Lock mode (see below), and skip setting up an LLM adapter.
        </Callout>
      </Step>
        Next, follow the [Remote Endpoint quickstart](/guides/backend-actions/remote-backend-endpoint) to setup a FastAPI Remote-Endpoint.<br/>
        **This endpoint will serve your (Python) LangGraph agent.**
      <Step>
        ## Connect your FastAPI Remote Endpoint to a LangGraph agent

        At this point you should have CopilotKit hooked into your application, connected to a FastAPI Remote Endpoint.

        The next step is to configure the Remote Endpoint to serve LangGraph agents.

        First, find your `CopilotKitRemoteEndpoint` instance in your Python Remote Endpoint (typically `server.py`). <br/>
        **Then modify your `CopilotKitRemoteEndpoint` instance (setup in the previous step) to serve LangGraph agents:**

        ```python title="server.py"
        from copilotkit import CopilotKitRemoteEndpoint, LangGraphAgent # [!code highlight]
        from .agent import the_langraph_graph # Import your LangGraph agent; in this example, it's the variable named `the_langraph_graph` in ./agent.py # [!code highlight]
        from copilotkit.integrations.fastapi import add_fastapi_endpoint
        from copilotkit.langchain import copilotkit_messages_to_langchain # you only need this if you use Google Gemini in your LangGraph agent.
        # ... other imports

        app = FastAPI()

        # ...

        # Initialize the CopilotKit SDK
        sdk = CopilotKitRemoteEndpoint(
          agents=[ # [!code highlight:10]
            LangGraphAgent(
              name="basic_agent",
              description="Agent that answers questions about the weather",
              graph=the_langraph_graph,
            )
          ],
          # ...
        )

        # ...

        # Add the CopilotKit endpoint to your FastAPI app
        add_fastapi_endpoint(app, sdk, "/copilotkit_remote")

        # ...

        ```

        <Callout>
          Remember the name `basic_agent`, we'll need it as we move on to integrating
          this agent into the frontend.
        </Callout>
      </Step>

    </Steps>

  </TailoredContentOption>
</TailoredContent>

##  Optionally: agent-lock your Copilot to the `basic_agent` agent.

CopilotKit supports multi-agent workflows through an [intelligent router](/coagents/advanced/router-mode-agent-lock) that is enabled by default.
If you would like to disable this intelligent routing and lock your Copilot to a single LangGraph agent, you can do so by setting the `agent` prop
to the name of the agent you want to lock to.

```tsx filename="src/page.tsx"
// The Copilot will now invoke the LangGraph agent directly, not the Copilot router.
<CopilotKit
  runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
  agent="basic_agent" // agent-lock the Copilot, see 'agent-lock vs router-mode' // [!code highlight]
>
  {...}
</CopilotKit>
```
