## Before you start

CoAgents integrate with LangGraph-powered agents which are either deployed to the LangGraph Platform or self-hosted with a FastAPI endpoint.

The LangGraph Platform deployment is recommended and supports both LangGraph.js and LangGraph python.
Raw self-hosting is currently only offered via CopilotKit's FastAPI-powered remote-endpoint.

**This guide assumes youâ€™re familiar with using LangGraph to build agent workflows.** If you need a quick introduction, 
check out [this brief example from the LangGraph docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).

## Getting started

In order for CopilotKit to integrate with your LangGraph agent, it has to be deployed either by yourself or on LangGraph Platform.

    **For orientation, here's how CoAgents are wired:**
    <CoAgentsDiagram />

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        First, take a minute to **[go through the CopilotKit quickstart](/quickstart), and integrate CopilotKit into your React app.**
        This should only take a minute.

        <Callout type="info">
          Note! that if you are planning to use only a single LangGraph agent as your app's agentic backend,
          you can use Agent-Lock mode (see below), and skip setting up an LLM adapter.
        </Callout>
      </Step>
        Next, follow the [Remote Endpoint quickstart](/guides/backend-actions/remote-backend-endpoint) to setup a FastAPI Remote-Endpoint.<br/>
        **This endpoint will serve your (Python) LangGraph agent.**
      <Step>
        ## Connect your FastAPI Remote Endpoint to a LangGraph agent

        At this point you should have CopilotKit hooked into your application, connected to a FastAPI Remote Endpoint.

        The next step is to configure the Remote Endpoint to serve LangGraph agents.

        First, find your `CopilotKitSDK` instance in your Python Remote Endpoint (typically `server.py`). <br/>
        **Then modify your `CopilotKitSDK` instance (setup in the previous step) to serve LangGraph agents:**

        ```python title="server.py"
        from copilotkit import CopilotKitSDK, LangGraphAgent # [!code highlight]
        from .agent import the_langraph_graph # Import your LangGraph agent; in this example, it's the variable named `the_langraph_graph` in ./agent.py # [!code highlight]
        from copilotkit.integrations.fastapi import add_fastapi_endpoint
        from copilotkit.langchain import copilotkit_messages_to_langchain # you only need this if you use Google Gemini in your LangGraph agent.
        # ... other imports

        app = FastAPI()

        # ...

        # Initialize the CopilotKit SDK
        sdk = CopilotKitSDK(
          agents=[ # [!code highlight:10]
            LangGraphAgent(
              name="basic_agent",
              description="Agent that answers questions about the weather",
              graph=the_langraph_graph,
              # copilotkit_config={ # if you use Google Gemini, uncomment  this code (and import `copilotkit_messages_to_langchain`, see above)
              #  "convert_messages": copilotkit_messages_to_langchain(use_function_call=True)
              # }
            )
          ],
          # ...
        )

        # ...

        # Add the CopilotKit endpoint to your FastAPI app
        add_fastapi_endpoint(app, sdk, "/copilotkit_remote")

        # ...

        ```

        <Callout>
          Remember the name `basic_agent`, we'll need it as we move on to integrating
          this agent into the frontend.
        </Callout>

        ### Are you using Google Gemini models?

        Until there is full parity between Gemini and other models in the LangChain ecosystem, you'll need to uncomment the `copilotkit_config` section shown above when using Gemini models in your LangGraph agent.
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ##  Optionally lock Copilot to the `basic_agent` agent.

        CopilotKit supports multi-agent workflows through an [intelligent router](/coagents/advanced/router-mode-agent-lock) that is enabled by default.
        If you would like to disable this intelligent routing and lock your Copilot to a single LangGraph agent, you can do so by setting the `agent` prop
        to the name of the agent you want to lock to.

        ```tsx filename="src/page.tsx"
        // The Copilot will now invoke the LangGraph agent directly, not the Copilot router.
        <CopilotKit
          runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
          agent="basic_agent" // agent-lock the Copilot, see 'agent-lock vs router-mode' // [!code highlight]
        >
          {...}
        </CopilotKit>
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>

      ## Deploy your LangGraph agent

      <Callout type="info">
        **If you have already deployed your LangGraph agent, skip to step 3.**
      </Callout>

      <LangGraphPlatformDeploymentTabs components={props.components} />

      ## Integrate your LangGraph agent with CopilotKit
      Now that you've deployed your agent to LangGraph Platform, you will need to integrate it into your CopilotKit application.

        <TailoredContentOption

              <CopilotKitCloudCopilotKitProvider components={props.components} />
            </Accordion>
          </Accordions>

          With your LangGraph deployment URL, all that is left is to register our LangGraph agent to the Copilot Cloud runtime.

        >
          <Steps>

            <Step>
              ## Find your CopilotRuntime instance
              <FindYourCopilotRuntime components={props.components} />
            </Step>
            <Step>
              ## Connect the app to the remote endpoint
              Once you've found your runtime instance, you can connect your app to the remote endpoint by modifying your CopilotRuntime configuration.

              ```tsx
                const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
                  // ...existing configuration
                  remoteEndpoints: [ 
                    langGraphPlatformEndpoint({
                      deploymentUrl: "your-api-url", // make sure to replace with your real deployment url // [!code highlight]
                      langsmithApiKey: process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY, // only used in LangGraph Platform deoployments
                      agents: [ // List any agents available under "graphs" list in your langgraph.json file; give each a description explaining when it should be called.
                        {
                          name: 'my_agent', // this name must match one of your graphs defined under the `langgraph.json` file  // [!code highlight]
                          description: 'A helpful LLM agent that should be used whenever the user needs assistance with general queries or tasks.' // [!code highlight]
                        }
                      ]
                    }),
                  ],
                });
              ```

              <Callout>
                Remember to replace `your-api-url` with your actual LangGraph Platform deployment URL and
                set your LangSmith API key as an environment variable.
              </Callout>
            </Step>
