## Implementation
<Callout>
Check out the [Frontend Actions overview](/frontend-actions) to understand what they are and when to use them.
</Callout>

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Setup CopilotKit

        To use frontend actions, you'll need to setup CopilotKit first. For the sake of brevity, we won't cover it here. 

        Check out our [getting started guide](/coagents/quickstart/langgraph) and come back here when you're setup!
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend action

        First, you'll need to create a frontend action using the [useCopilotAction](/reference/hooks/useCopilotAction) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]
            
        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:16]
          useCopilotAction({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            available: "remote", // optional, makes it so the action is *only* available to the agent
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler: async ({ name }) => {
              alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ###  Modify your agent
        Now, we'll need to modify the agent to access these frontend actions. Open up for your agent's folder and continue from there!
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Install the CopilotKit SDK
        <InstallSDKSnippet components={props.components}/>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Inheriting from CopilotKitState

        To access the frontend actions provided by CopilotKit, you can inherit from CopilotKitState in your agent's state definition:

        <Tabs groupId="language" items={['Python', 'TypeScript']} default="Python">
            <Tab value="Python">
                ```python title="agent-py/sample_agent/agent.py"
                from copilotkit import CopilotKitState # [!code highlight]

                class YourAgentState(CopilotKitState): # [!code highlight]
                    your_additional_properties: str
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="TypeScript">
                ```typescript title="agent-js/src/agent.ts"
                import { Annotation } from "@langchain/langgraph";
                import { CopilotKitStateAnnotation } from "@copilotkit/sdk-js/langgraph"; // [!code highlight]

                export const YourAgentStateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
                    yourAdditionalProperty: Annotation<string>,
                    ...CopilotKitStateAnnotation.spec, // [!code highlight]
                });
                export type YourAgentState = typeof YourAgentStateAnnotation.State;
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        By doing this, your agent's state will include the `copilotkit` property, which contains the frontend actions that can be accessed and invoked.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Accessing Frontend Actions

        Once your agent's state includes the `copilotkit` property, you can access the frontend actions and utilize them within your agent's logic.

        Here's how you can call a frontend action from your agent:

        <Tabs groupId="language" items={['Python', 'TypeScript']} default="Python">
            <Tab value="Python">
                ```python title="agent-py/sample_agent/agent.py"
                async def agent_node(state: YourAgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
                    # Access the actions from the copilotkit property

                    actions = state.get("copilotkit", {}).get("actions", []) # [!code highlight]
                    model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o").bind_tools(actions)

                    # ...
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="TypeScript">
                ```typescript title="agent-js/src/agent.ts"
                async function agentNode(state: YourAgentState, config: RunnableConfig): Promise<YourAgentState> {
                    // Access the actions from the copilotkit property

                    const actions = state.copilotkit?.actions; // [!code highlight]
                    const model = ChatOpenAI({ model: 'gpt-4o' }).bindTools(actions);

                    // ...
                }
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        These actions are automatically populated by CopilotKit and are compatible with LangChain's tool call definitions, making it straightforward to integrate them into your agent's workflow.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any CopilotActions you've defined. These actions will be available as tools to the agent where they can be used as needed.
    </Step>
