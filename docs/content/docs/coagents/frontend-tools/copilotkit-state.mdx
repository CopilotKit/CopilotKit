## Background

In agent-based applications, there is often a need to interact with frontend actions or tools. CopilotKit provides a seamless way to access these frontend actions directly from your agent's state. By inheriting from CopilotKitState, you can integrate frontend actions into your agent's workflow.

<Callout>
  Leveraging **CopilotKitState** allows you to access and invoke frontend
  actions from your agent's state effortlessly. These actions are compatible
  with LangChain's tool call definitions, enabling smooth integration between
  backend logic and the frontend interface.

## Inheriting from CopilotKitState

To access the frontend actions provided by CopilotKit, you can inherit from CopilotKitState in your agent's state definition:

<Tabs groupId="language" items={['Python', 'TypeScript']} default="Python">
    <Tab value="Python">
        ```python
        from copilotkit import CopilotKitState

        class YourAgentState(CopilotKitState):
            your_additional_properties: str
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="TypeScript">
        ```typescript
        import { Annotation } from "@langchain/langgraph";
        import { CopilotKitStateAnnotation } from "@copilotkit/sdk-js/langgraph";

        export const YourAgentStateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
            yourAdditionalProperty: Annotation<string>,
            ...CopilotKitStateAnnotation.spec,
        });
        export type YourAgentState = typeof YourAgentStateAnnotation.State;
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

By doing this, your agent's state will include the `copilotkit` property, which contains the frontend actions that can be accessed and invoked.

## Accessing Frontend Actions

Once your agent's state includes the `copilotkit` property, you can access the frontend actions and utilize them within your agent's logic.

Here's how you can call a frontend action from your agent:

<Tabs groupId="language" items={['Python', 'TypeScript']} default="Python">
    <Tab value="Python">
        ```python
        async def agent_node(state: YourAgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
            # Access the actions from the copilotkit property

            actions = state["copilotkit"]["actions"]
            model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o").bind_tools(actions)

            # ...
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="TypeScript">
        ```typescript
        async function agentNode(state: YourAgentState, config: RunnableConfig): Promise<YourAgentState> {
            // Access the actions from the copilotkit property

            const actions = state.copilotkit.actions;
            const model = ChatOpenAI({ model: 'gpt-4o' }).bindTools(actions);

            // ...
        }
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

These actions are automatically populated by CopilotKit and are compatible with LangChain's tool call definitions, making it straightforward to integrate them into your agent's workflow.
