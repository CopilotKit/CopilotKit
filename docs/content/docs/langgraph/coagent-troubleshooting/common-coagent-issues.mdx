## My tool calls are not being streamed

This could be due to a few different reasons.

First, we strongly recommend checking out our [Human In the Loop](/coagents/human-in-the-loop) guide to follow a more in depth example of how to stream tool calls
in your LangGraph agents. You can also check out our [travel tutorial](/coagents/tutorials/ai-travel-app/step-6-human-in-the-loop) which talks about how to stream
tool calls in a more complex example.

If you have already done that, you can check the following:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="You have not specified the tool call in the `copilotkit_customize_config`">
        In your LangGraph agent, you have must specify which tool calls will be emitted to the CopilotKit runtime. By default,
        only streamed messages are emitted. You can fix this by adding the following to the node making the tool call.

        ```python
        from copilotkit.langgraph import copilotkit_customize_config, copilotkit_emit_message
        from langgraph_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
        from langchain.tools import tool

        @tool
        def say_hello_to(name: str) -> str:
            return f"Hello, {name}!"

        async def my_node(state: State, config: RunnableConfig) -> State:
            # ...
            config = copilotkit_customize_config(config, emit_tool_calls=["say_hello_to"]) # [code highlight]
            # ...
            return state
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="You're using llm.invoke() instead of llm.ainvoke()">
        <p>
            When you invoke your LangGraph agent, you can invoke it synchronously or asynchronously. If you invoke it synchronously,
            the tool calls will not be streamed progressively, only the final result will be streamed. If you invoke it asynchronously,
            the tool calls will be streamed progressively.

            ```python
            config = copilotkit_customize_config(config, emit_tool_calls=["say_hello_to"])
            response = await llm_with_tools.ainvoke(
                [ SystemMessage(content=system_message), *state["messages"] ],
                config=config
            )
            ```
        </p>
    </Accordion>

</Accordions>

## Error: `'AzureOpenAI' object has no attribute 'bind_tools'`

This error is typically due to the use of an incorrect import from LangGraph. Instead of importing `AzureOpenAI` import `AzureChatOpenAI` and your
issue will be resolved.

```python
from langchain_openai import AzureOpenAI # [!code --]
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI # [!code ++]
```

## I am getting "agent not found" error

If you're seeing this error, it means CopilotKit couldn't find the LangGraph agent you're trying to use. Here's how to fix it:

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Verify your agent lock mode configuration">
        If you're using [agent lock mode](/coagents/multi-agent-flows),
        check that the agent defined in `langgraph.json` matches what's defined in the CopilotKit provider:

        ```json title="langgraph.json"
        {
            "python_version": "3.12",
            "dockerfile_lines": [],
            "dependencies": ["."],
            "graphs": {
                "my_agent": "./src/agent.py:graph"// In this case, "my_agent" is the agent you're using // [!code highlight]
            },
            "env": ".env"
        }
        ```

        ```tsx title="layout.tsx"
        <CopilotKit agent="my_agent"> // [!code highlight]
            {/* Your application components */}
        </CopilotKit>
        ```

        Common issues:
        - Typos in agent names
        - Case sensitivity mismatches
        - Missing entries in `langgraph.json`
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Check your agent registration on a LangGraph Platform endpoint">
        When using LangGraph Platform endpoint, make sure your agents are properly specified and are following the definition in your `langgraph.json`:

        ```json title="langgraph.json"
        {
            "python_version": "3.12",
            "dockerfile_lines": [],
            "dependencies": ["."],
            "graphs": {
                "my_agent": "./src/agent.py:graph"// In this case, "my_agent" is the agent you're using // [!code highlight]
            },
            "env": ".env"
        }
        ```

        ```typescript title="/copilotkit/api/route.ts"
        const runtime = new CopilotRuntime({
          // ... The rest of your CopilotRuntime definition
          agents: { // [!code highlight:7]
            'my_agent': new LangGraphAgent({
              deploymentUrl: '<your-api-url>',
              graphId: 'my_agent',
              langsmithApiKey: '<your-langsmith-api-key>' // Optional
            }),
          },
        });
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Check your agent name in useCoAgent">
        Make sure the that the agent defined in `langgraph.json` matches what you use n `useCoAgent` hook:

        ```json title="langgraph.json"
        {
            "python_version": "3.12",
            "dockerfile_lines": [],
            "dependencies": ["."],
            "graphs": {
                "my_agent": "./src/agent.py:graph"// In this case, "my_agent" is the agent you're using // [!code highlight]
            },
            "env": ".env"
        }
        ```

        ```tsx title="MyComponent.tsx"
        // Your React component
        useCoAgent({
            name: "my_agent", // [!code focus] This must match exactly
        });
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Check your agent name in useCoAgentStateRender">
        Make sure the that the agent defined in `langgraph.json` matches what you use n `useCoAgent` hook:

        ```json title="langgraph.json"
        {
            "python_version": "3.12",
            "dockerfile_lines": [],
            "dependencies": ["."],
            "graphs": {
                "my_agent": "./src/agent.py:graph"// In this case, "my_agent" is the agent you're using // [!code highlight]
            },
            "env": ".env"
        }
        ```

        ```tsx title="MyComponent.tsx"
        // Your React component
        useCoAgentStateRender({
            name: "my_agent", // [!code focus] This must match exactly
        });
        ```
    </Accordion>

</Accordions>

## Connection issues with tunnel creation

If you notice the tunnel creation process spinning indefinitely, your router or ISP might be blocking the connection to CopilotKit's tunnel service.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Router or ISP blocking tunnel connections">
        To verify connectivity to the tunnel service, try these commands:

        ```bash
        ping tunnels.devcopilotkit.com
        curl -I https://tunnels.devcopilotkit.com
        telnet tunnels.devcopilotkit.com 443
        ```

        If these fail, your router's security features or ISP might be blocking the connection. Common solutions:
        - Check router security settings
        - Consider checking with your ISP about any connection restrictions
        - Try using a mobile hotspot
    </Accordion>

</Accordions>

## I am getting "Failed to find or contact remote endpoint at url, Make sure the API is running and that it's indeed a LangGraph platform url" error

If you're seeing this error, it means the LangGraph platform client cannot connect to your endpoint.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Verify the endpoint is reachable">
        Check the logs for the backend API running on the remote endpoint url. Make sure it is up and ready to receive requests
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Verify running a LangGraph platform endpoint using LangGraph deployment tools">
        Verify that the backend API is running using `langgraph dev`, `langgraph up`, on a LangGraph cloud url or equivalent methods supplied by LangGraph
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Verify the remote endpoint matches the endpoint definition type">
        If you are running your remote endpoint using FastAPI, even if it uses LangGraph for the agent, it is not considered a LangGraph platform endpoint.
        You may need to change your `remoteEndpoints` definition for this endpoint to match the expected format.

        Change the endpoint definition, from:
        ```
        new CopilotRuntime({
          remoteEndpoints: [
            langGraphPlatformEndpoint({
            deploymentUrl: "https://your-fastapi-endpoint:port",
            langsmithApiKey: '<langsmith API key>' // optional
            agents: [], // Your previous agents definition
          ],
        });

        // or

        new CopilotRuntime({
          agents: {
            'agent-name': new LangGraphAgent({
              deploymentUrl: "https://your-fastapi-endpoint:port",
              langsmithApiKey: '<langsmith API key>', // optional
              graphId: 'langgraph.json graph id', // Your previous graphId definition
            }),
          }
        });
        ```

        To:
        ```
        new CopilotRuntime({
            agents: {
                'agent-name': new LangGraphHttpAgent({
                    url: 'https://your-fastapi-endpoint:port/your-agent-uri'
                }),
            }
        });
        ```
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## I am getting a "No checkpointer set" error when using LangGraph with FastAPI

If you're encountering this error, it means you are missing a checkpointer in your compiled graph.
You can visit the [LangGraph Persistence guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/persistence/#checkpoints) to understand what a checkpointer is and how to add it.

## I see messages being streamed and disappear

LangGraph agents are stateful. As a graph is traversed, the state is saved at the end of each node. CopilotKit uses the agent's state as
the source of truth for what to display in the frontend chat. However, since state is only emitted at the end of a node,  CopilotKit allows
you to stream predictive state updates *in the middle of a node*. By default, CopilotKit will stream messages and tool calls being actively
generated to the frontend chat that initiated the interaction. **If this predictive state is not persisted at the end of the node, it will 
disappear in the frontend chat**.

In this situation, the most likely scenario is that the `messages` property in the state is being updated in the middle of a node but those edits are not being
persisted at the end of a node.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="I want these messages to be persisted">
        To fix this, you can simply persist the messages by returning the new messages at the end of the node.
