One of the most common use cases for CopilotKit is to register app state and context using `useCopilotReadable`.
This way, you can notify CopilotKit of what is going in your app in real time.
Some examples might be: the current user, the current page, etc.

This context can then be shared with your AG-UI server and agent logic.

## Implementation

    Check out the [Frontend Data documentation](https://docs.copilotkit.ai/direct-to-llm/guides/connect-your-data/frontend) to understand what this is and how to use it.

    <Step>
        ### Add the data to the Copilot

        The [`useCopilotReadable` hook](/reference/hooks/useCopilotReadable) is used to add data as context to the Copilot.

        ```tsx title="YourComponent.tsx" showLineNumbers {1, 7-10}
        "use client" // only necessary if you are using Next.js with the App Router. // [!code highlight]
        import { useCopilotReadable } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]
        import { useState } from 'react';

        export function YourComponent() {
            // Create colleagues state with some sample data
            const [colleagues, setColleagues] = useState([
                { id: 1, name: "John Doe", role: "Developer" },
                { id: 2, name: "Jane Smith", role: "Designer" },
                { id: 3, name: "Bob Wilson", role: "Product Manager" }
            ]);

            // Define Copilot readable state
            // [!code highlight:4]
            useCopilotReadable({
                description: "The current user's colleagues",
                value: colleagues,
            });
            return (
                // Your custom UI component
                <>...</>
            );
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Consume the data in your AG-UI server
        The `context` you register on the frontend is forwarded to your AG-UI server handler. You can extract items by description and pass them to your agent logic.

        ```csharp title="Program.cs"
        using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
        using Azure.Identity;
        using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
        using Microsoft.Agents.AI.Hosting.AGUI.AspNetCore;

        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
        builder.Services.AddAGUI();
        var app = builder.Build();

        string endpoint = builder.Configuration["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"]!;
        string deployment = builder.Configuration["AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"]!;

        // Create the agent
        //// TODO: Needs to be updated with actual sample that access the context
        var agent = new AzureOpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new DefaultAzureCredential())
            .GetChatClient(deployment)
            .CreateAIAgent(
                name: "AGUIAssistant",
                instructions: "You are a helpful assistant. Use the provided context about colleagues to answer questions.");

        // Map the AG-UI endpoint
        app.MapAGUI("/", agent);
        await app.RunAsync();
        ```

        <Callout type="info">
          Context registered with `useCopilotReadable` is automatically forwarded by the AG-UI protocol. Your agent receives this context and can use it to provide personalized responses. The LLM will have access to the context in its prompt.
        </Callout>

        <Callout type="tip">
          **Configuration & Error Handling**: This example uses environment variables for configuration. Set `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` via `appsettings.json`, user-secrets, or environment variables. For production deployments, add appropriate error handling and consider using the [Quickstart](/microsoft-agent-framework/quickstart) or [Authentication](/microsoft-agent-framework/auth) guides for complete setup patterns.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        Ask your agent a question about the context. It should be able to answer!
