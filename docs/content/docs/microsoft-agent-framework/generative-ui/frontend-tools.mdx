## What is this?
Frontend tools enable you to define client-side functions that your agent can invoke, with execution happening entirely in the user's browser. When your agent calls a frontend tool,
the logic runs on the client side, giving you direct access to the frontend environment.

This can be utilized to let your agent control the UI, power generative UI, or for Human-in-the-loop interactions.

In this guide, we cover the use of frontend tools for generative UI.

## When should I use this?
Use frontend tools when you need your agent to interact with client-side primitives such as:
- Reading or modifying React component state
- Accessing browser APIs like localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies
- Triggering UI updates or animations
- Interacting with third-party frontend libraries
- Performing actions that require the user's immediate browser context

        ### Create a frontend tool

        First, you'll need to create a frontend tool using the [useFrontendTool](/reference/hooks/useFrontendTool) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useFrontendTool } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:25]
          useFrontendTool({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler({ name }) {
              // Handler returns the result of the tool call
              return { currentURLPath: window.location.href, userName: name };
            },
            render: ({ args }) => {
              // Renders UI based on the data of the tool call
              return (
                <div>
                  <h1>Hello, {args.name}!</h1>
                  <h1>You're currently on {window.location.href}</h1>
                </div>
              );
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Modify your server
        Ensure your AG-UI server receives the frontend tools and passes them to your agent logic as needed.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Receiving frontend tools on the server

        When CopilotKit calls your AG-UI server, frontend tools registered with `useHumanInTheLoop` are forwarded to your AG-UI server
        and passed to the underlying agent via the AgentRunOptions on the server. They are automatically available by default to the
        underlying chat client.

        ```csharp title="Program.cs"
        using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
        using Microsoft.Agents.AI.Hosting.AGUI.AspNetCore;
        using OpenAI;

        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
        builder.Services.AddAGUI();
        var app = builder.Build();

        var githubToken = builder.Configuration["GitHubToken"]!;
        var openAI = new OpenAIClient(
            new System.ClientModel.ApiKeyCredential(githubToken),
            new OpenAIClientOptions { Endpoint = new Uri("https://models.inference.ai.azure.com") });

        // Create the agent - frontend tools are automatically available
        var agent = openAI.GetChatClient("gpt-4o-mini")
            .CreateAIAgent(name: "SampleAgent", instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.");

        // Map the AG-UI endpoint
        app.MapAGUI("/", agent);
        app.Run("http://localhost:8000");
        ```

        <Callout type="info">
          Frontend tools registered with `useFrontendTool` are automatically forwarded to your agent through the AG-UI protocol. The agent can invoke them, and execution happens on the frontend.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any frontend tools you've defined. These tools will be available to the agent where they can be used as needed.
    </Step>
</Steps>
