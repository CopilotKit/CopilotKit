## What is this?
Frontend tools enable you to define client-side functions that your agent can invoke, with execution happening entirely in the user's browser. When your agent calls a frontend tool,
the logic runs on the client side, giving you direct access to the frontend environment.

This can be utilized to let your agent control the UI, power generative UI, or support Human-in-the-loop interactions.

In this guide, we cover the use of frontend tools driving and interacting with the UI.

## When should I use this?
Use frontend tools when you need your agent to interact with client-side primitives such as:
- Reading or modifying React component state
- Accessing browser APIs like localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies
- Triggering UI updates or animations
- Interacting with third-party frontend libraries
- Performing actions that require the user's immediate browser context

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Run and connect your agent
        <RunAndConnect components={props.components} />
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend tool

        First, you'll need to create a frontend tool using the [useFrontendTool](/reference/hooks/useFrontendTool) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useFrontendTool } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:15]
          useFrontendTool({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler: async ({ name }) => {
              alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Modify your server
        Now, we'll ensure your AG-UI server can receive and pass these frontend actions to your agent logic.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Create your AG-UI server

        Set up your AG-UI server to serve your agent. Frontend tools registered with `useFrontendTool` are automatically
        made available to your agent through the AG-UI protocol.

        ```csharp title="Program.cs"
        using Azure.AI.OpenAI;
        using Azure.Identity;
        using Microsoft.Agents.AI;
        using Microsoft.Agents.AI.Hosting.AGUI.AspNetCore;

        var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
        builder.Services.AddAGUI();
        var app = builder.Build();

        string endpoint = builder.Configuration["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"]!;
        string deployment = builder.Configuration["AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"]!;

        // Create the agent
        var agent = new AzureOpenAIClient(new Uri(endpoint), new DefaultAzureCredential())
            .GetChatClient(deployment)
            .CreateAIAgent(name: "AGUIAssistant", instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.");

        // Map the AG-UI endpoint
        app.MapAGUI("/", agent);
        await app.RunAsync();
        ```

        <Callout type="info">
          Frontend tools registered with `useFrontendTool` are automatically forwarded to your agent by the AG-UI protocol. The agent can invoke them just like backend tools, but execution happens on the frontend.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any frontend tools you've defined. These tools will be available to the agent where they can be used as needed.
