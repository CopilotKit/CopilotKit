## What is this?
Frontend tools enable you to define client-side functions that your Pydantic AI agent can invoke, with execution happening entirely in the user's browser. When your agent calls a frontend tool,
the logic runs on the client side, giving you direct access to the frontend environment.

This can be utilized for to let [your agent control the UI](/pydantic-ai/frontend-actions), [generative UI](/pydantic-ai/generative-ui/frontend-tools), or for Human-in-the-loop interactions.

In this guide, we cover the use of frontend tools for generative UI.

## When should I use this?
Use frontend tools when you need your agent to interact with client-side primitives such as:
- Reading or modifying React component state
- Accessing browser APIs like localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies
- Triggering UI updates or animations
- Interacting with third-party frontend libraries
- Performing actions that require the user's immediate browser context

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
      ### Run and connect your agent

      You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding. If you haven't done so already,
      you can follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](/pydantic-ai/quickstart/pydantic-ai) guide.

      If you don't already have an agent, you can use the [starter project](/pydantic-ai/quickstart/pydantic-ai) as a starting point
      as this guide uses it as a starting point.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend tool

        First, you'll need to create a frontend tool using the [useFrontendTool](/reference/hooks/useFrontendTool) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useFrontendTool } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:25]
          useFrontendTool({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler({ name }) {
              // Handler returns the result of the tool call
              return { currentURLPath: window.location.href, userName: name };
            },
            render: ({ args }) => {
              // Renders UI based on the data of the tool call
              return (
                <div>
                  <h1>Hello, {args.name}!</h1>
                  <h1>You're currently on {window.location.href}</h1>
                </div>
              );
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ###  Modify your agent
        Now, we'll need to modify the agent to access these frontend actions. Open up your agent's folder and continue from there!
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Setup your Pydantic AI agent with frontend tools

        Frontend tools registered with `useFrontendTool` are automatically forwarded to your agent through the AG-UI protocol. The agent can invoke them, and execution happens on the frontend.

        <Tabs groupId="language_pydantic-ai_agent" items={['Python']} default="Python" persist>
            <Tab value="Python">
                ```python title="agent/sample_agent/agent.py"
                from pydantic_ai import Agent

                agent = Agent("openai:gpt-4o-mini")


                # Frontend tools are automatically available to the agent
                # through the AG-UI protocol when registered with useFrontendTool

                app = agent.to_ag_ui()

                if __name__ == "__main__":
                    import uvicorn

                    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        <Callout type="info">
          Frontend tools registered with `useFrontendTool` are automatically forwarded to your agent through the AG-UI protocol. The agent can invoke them, and execution happens on the frontend.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any frontend tools you've defined. These tools will be available to the agent where they can be used as needed.
