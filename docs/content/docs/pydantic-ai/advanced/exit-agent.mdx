After your agent has finished a workflow, you'll usually want to explicitly end that loop by calling the `copilotkit_exit()` method in your Python code.

Exiting the agent has different effects depending on mode:

- **Router Mode**: Exiting the agent hands responsibility for handling input back to the router, which can initiate chat, call actions, other agents, etc. The router can return to this agent later (starting a new loop) to satisfy a user request.

- **Agent Lock Mode**: Exiting the agent restarts the workflow loop for the current agent.

In this example from [our email-sending app](https://github.com/copilotkit/copilotkit/tree/main/examples/coagents-qa), the `send_email` node explicitly exits, then manually sends a response back to the user as a `ToolMessage`:

        ### Install the CopilotKit SDK
        <InstallSDKSnippet components={props.components}/>
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Exit the agent loop
        This will exit the agent session as soon as the current Pydantic AI run is finished, either by a breakpoint or by reaching the `END` node.
