## What is this?

By default, CopilotKit will stream both your state and tool calls to the frontend.
You can disable this by using CopilotKit's custom `RunnableConfig`.

## When should I use this?

Occasionally, you'll want to disable streaming temporarily â€” for example, the LLM may be
doing something the current user should not see, like emitting tool calls or questions
pertaining to other employees in an HR system.

## Implementation

### Disable all streaming

You can decide wether to stream messages or tool calls by selectively wrapping calls to `completion`
with `copilotkit_stream`.
