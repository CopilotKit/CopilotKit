Before we dive into what agentic copilots are, help us help you by telling us 
your level of experience with LangGraph. We'll explain things in a way that best suits your experience level.

        ### What are Agents?
        AI agents are intelligent systems that interact with their environment to achieve specific goals. Think of them as 'virtual colleagues' that can handle tasks ranging from 
        simple queries like "find the cheapest flight to Paris" to complex challenges like "design a new product layout."

        As these AI-driven experiences (or 'Agentic Experiences') become more sophisticated, developers need finer control over how agents make decisions. This is where specialized 
        frameworks like LangGraph become essential.

        ### What is LangGraph?
        LangGraph is a framework that gives you precise control over AI agents. It uses a graph-based approach where each step in an agent's decision-making process is represented 
        by a `node`. These nodes are connected by `edges` to form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), creating a clear map of possible actions and decisions.

        The key advantage of LangGraph is its tight control over the agent's decision making process. Since all of this is defined in code by you, the behavior is much more
        deterministic and predictable.

        ### What are 'Agentic Copilots'?
        Agentic Copilots are how CopilotKit brings LangGraph agents into your application. If you're familiar with CopilotKit, you know that copilots are AI assistants that 
        understand your app's context and can take actions within it. While CopilotKit's standard copilots use a simplified [ReAct pattern](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/what-s-a-react-agent-5hu7ZOaKSAuY7YdFjQLCNQ) 
        for quick implementation, Agentic Copilots give you LangGraph's full orchestration capabilities when you need more control over your agent's behavior.

        ### When should I use CopilotKit's Agentic Copilots?
        You should use Agentic Copilots when you require tight control over the Agentic runloop, as facilitated by an Agentic Orchestration framework like [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/).
        With Agentic Copilots, you can carry all of your existing CopilotKit-enabled Copilot capabilities into a customized agentic runloop.

        We suggest beginning with a basic Copilot and gradually transitioning specific components to Agentic Copilots.
        
        The need for Agentic Copilots spans a broad spectrum across different applications. At one end, their advanced capabilities might not be required at all, or only for a minimal 10% of the application's functionality. Progressing further, there are scenarios where they become increasingly vital, managing 60-70% of operations. Ultimately, in some cases, Agentic Copilots are indispensable, orchestrating up to 100% of the Copilot's tasks (see [agent-lock mode](/coagents/advanced/router-mode-agent-lock#agent-lock-mode) for the 100% case).

        ### Examples
        An excellent example of the type of experiences you can accomplish with Agentic Copilot applications can be found in our [Research Canvas](/examples/coagents-research-canvas).
        
        More specifically, it demonstrates how Agentic Copilots allow for AI driven experiences with:
        - Precise state management across agent interactions
        - Sophisticated multi-step reasoning capabilities
        - Seamless orchestration of multiple AI tools
        - Interactive human-AI collaboration features
        - Real-time state updates and progress streaming

        LangChain's LangGraph is a framework for building deeply customizable AI agents.

        CopilotKit's Agentic Copilots is infrastruture for in-app agent-user interaction, i.e. for transforming agents from autonomous processes to user-interactive 'virtual colleagues' that live inside applications.

        Any LangGraph-based agent can be transformed into an Agentic Copilot with a minimal amount
        of effort to get industry leading agnetic UX such as:
        - Shared state between the agent and the application.
        - Intermediate result and state progress streaming
        - Human-in-the-loop collaboration
        - Agentic generative UI

        And more.

        All of these features are essential to delight instead of frustrate your users with AI features. Ready to get started?
