## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.10–3.13

## 1) Install the Agent Spec AG‑UI adapter (backend)

The AG‑UI integration for Agent Spec lives in `ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python`. Here's how to install it:

```bash
# Clone the adapter and move into the Python package
git clone https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui.git
cd ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python
```

As this integration package uses `uv` as the package manager, you can easily install it with:

```bash
uv sync
```

Agent Spec is a specification language that declares the structure of your agents and workflows. Agent Spec agents can be run on various agent frameworks. Currently, we support LangGraph and WayFlow (Oracle's reference agent framework, with native support for Agent Spec).
Here are the different installation options depending on which agent framework you want to execute your Agent Spec agent on:

```bash
uv sync --extra langgraph                         # for LangGraph
uv sync --extra wayflow                           # for WayFlow
uv sync --extra langgraph --extra wayflow         # for both
```

Alternatively, you can use `pip`:

```bash
pip install -e .[wayflow]
pip install -e .[langgraph]
pip install -e .[wayflow,langgraph]
```

Note: these commands would install [`pyagentspec`](https://github.com/oracle/agent-spec) and [`wayflowcore`](https://github.com/oracle/wayflow) packages from source (i.e. the respective GitHub repos).
Instead, you can install these packages from PyPI separately:

```bash
pip install pyagentspec[langgraph]
pip install wayflowcore
```

Environment:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

Note that these environment variables can point to any OpenAI-compatible LLM provider (e.g., local vLLM server, Together AI), but the variable names need to be `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_MODEL`.

## 2) Scaffold the UI

Start from our starter template:

```bash
npx copilotkit@latest create -f agent-spec
```

Or use the full starter repo template: https://github.com/CopilotKit/with-agent-spec. It includes an example definition of an Agent Spec agent [here](https://github.com/CopilotKit/with-agent-spec/blob/main/agent/src/agentspec_agent.py).

Note that the `npx` command automatically installs the AG-UI Agent Spec integration at https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui/tree/main/integrations/agent-spec/python, which install `pyagentspec` and optional runtime adapter dependencies as explained above.

### Minimal starter Agent Spec agent definition

```python agentspec_agent.py
from pyagentspec.agent import Agent
from pyagentspec.llms import OpenAiCompatibleConfig
from pyagentspec.serialization import AgentSpecSerializer

agentspec_agent = Agent(
    name="AgentSpecAgent",
    description="A starter Agent that can call tools.",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant, named Specky, that speaks a lot.",
    llm_config=OpenAiCompatibleConfig(
        name="my-llm",
        model_id="gpt-4o",
        url="https://api.openai.com/v1",
    ),
)

agent_spec_config = AgentSpecSerializer().to_json(agentspec_agent)
```

## 3) Add a minimal FastAPI endpoint (backend)

Create a FastAPI app that loads your Agent Spec file and exposes an AG‑UI FastAPI endpoint. Replace the `runtime` to match your adapter (`langgraph` or `wayflow`).

```python src/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from ag_ui_agentspec.agent import AgentSpecAgent
from ag_ui_agentspec.endpoint import add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint

agent_spec_config = <loaded json/yaml string of your Agent Spec agent>
runtime = "langgraph"  # or "wayflow"

app = FastAPI()
agent = AgentSpecAgent(agent_spec_config=agent_spec_config, runtime=runtime)
add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint(app, agentspec_agent=agent, path="/")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("main:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True)
```

Here, we use the `add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint` utility from the integration pacakge. It sets up the endpoint and the wiring of Agent Spec Tracing events to AG-UI events.

To run the backend agent:

```bash
uv run src/main.py
```

## 4) Connect the UI to your frontend server

Make sure the frontend UI server knows what host/port the backend agent is running on. In this tutorial, we use http://localhost:8000/ as the host/port.

## 5) Run Next.js

From the root directory of [our starter repo](https://github.com/sonleoracle/with-agent-spec/), run:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or npm run dev / yarn dev / bun dev
```

Note that this command also launches the agent backend in `agent/src`. Now, open http://localhost:3000 and start chatting with your agent.

## Tools and tool registry

If your Agent Spec includes server-side tools that execute in the same environment as the agent, map them by name to Python callables in a dictionary `tool_registry` when loading `AgentSpecAgent`.

```python title="Bind backend tools by name"
from __future__ import annotations
from fastapi import FastAPI
from ag_ui_agentspec.agent import AgentSpecAgent
from ag_ui_agentspec.endpoint import add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint

def get_weather(city: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {"city": city, "temp_c": 22}

tool_registry = {"get_weather": get_weather}

app = FastAPI()
agent = AgentSpecAgent(
    agent_spec_config=<json/yaml string of your Agent Spec Agent>,
    runtime="langgraph",  # or "wayflow"
    tool_registry=tool_registry,
)
add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint(app, agentspec_agent=agent, path="/")
```

Frontend tools (corresponding to Agent Spec `ClientTool`) run in the browser and don't need to be added to the tool registry — see [Generative UI Frontend Tools](/agent-spec/generative-ui/frontend-tools) for details.

## What is happening under the hood

Agent Spec, and the `pyagentspec` SDK, helps you define agents and workflows in a readable and portable config object/JSON file.
The different adapters, LangGraph and WayFlow, loads your Agent Spec configs into framework-specific objects and executes them. In other words, Agent Spec is the "compiler", and the frameworks are the "runtimes".
During this conversion process, the adapter configures the loaded object so that it would emit Agent Spec Tracing events. These are standardized across runtimes.
Finally, the AG-UI Agent Spec integration listens to Agent Spec Tracing events and exports them to AG-UI events. These include agent execution, tool calls, messages being sent by the agent, etc.
In other words, if the agent emits an event during execution (this is runtime-dependent), a corresponding AG-UI event will be created.
In the frontend, CopilotKit converts and renders AG-UI events into the UI.
