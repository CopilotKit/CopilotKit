## What is this?

Wire an Agent Spec agent backed by WayFlow to CopilotKit’s UI via the AG‑UI event protocol. You’ll run a FastAPI endpoint that emits AG‑UI events and point your Next.js app at it.

Key pieces:
- Backend endpoint: `ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python/ag_ui_agentspec/endpoint.py`
- Example server: `ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python/examples/server.py`
- Template UI: `npx copilotkit@latest create -f agent-spec`

## When should I use this?

Use this integration when you already have a WayFlow-based agent described by an Agent Spec and want a turnkey UI that streams assistant text, tool calls/results, and run lifecycle with minimal wiring.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10–3.14
- Node.js 20+
- An Agent Spec config JSON/YAML file (or Python code via `pyagentspec`)

## Install runtime adapter

From the AG‑UI repo’s Agent Spec adapter package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui.git
cd ag-ui/integrations/agent-spec/python
uv pip install -e .[wayflow]
```

Note that this installs `wayflowcore` from source. Alternatively, you may install it with pip:

```bash
pip install wayflowcore
```

## Steps

<Steps>

<Step>
### 1. Start a FastAPI endpoint (minimal example)

Use the WayFlow runtime to execute your Agent Spec and stream AG‑UI events.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from ag_ui_agentspec.agent import AgentSpecAgent
from ag_ui_agentspec.endpoint import add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint

agentspec_json = <loaded json/yaml of your Agent Spec config>

app = FastAPI()
agent = AgentSpecAgent(agentspec_json, runtime="wayflow")
add_agentspec_fastapi_endpoint(app, agentspec_agent=agent, path="/")
```

Run locally:

```bash
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

</Step>

<Step>
### 2. Scaffold and connect the UI

<RunAndConnect />

If you already have the starter, make sure your agent runs on port 8000.

Then run the app (for example with `pnpm dev`) and open `http://localhost:3000`.

</Step>

</Steps>

## How it works

- `AgentSpecAgent(runtime="wayflow")` executes your Agent Spec agent with the WayFlow framework.
- `AgUiSpanProcessor` maps Agent Spec tracing spans to AG‑UI events on a per‑request queue (`EVENT_QUEUE`).
- The FastAPI endpoint streams those events as SSE for CopilotKit to render:
  - assistant text: `TEXT_MESSAGE_START/CONTENT/END`
  - tool calls: `TOOL_CALL_START/ARGS/END` and `TOOL_CALL_RESULT`
  - lifecycle: `RUN_STARTED/RUN_FINISHED`

## Troubleshooting

- The endpoint path must match your UI’s expected agent endpoint (port 8000 in our starter repo).
- The endpoint asserts a queue is bound. If you get queue errors, check that requests go through the provided FastAPI route.
- If you are not receiving any events, make sure the agent is running and did not crash.

## Next steps

- Build richer UIs with agentic chat and generative UI.
- Pass full chat history between turns. The adapter and processor handle messages and tool‑call lifecycle for you.
