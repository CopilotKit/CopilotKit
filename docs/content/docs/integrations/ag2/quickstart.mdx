## Introduction

This quickstart guide shows how to build a **Weather Agent** using AG2 and CopilotKit. In just minutes, you'll have a working application where users can ask for real-time weather conditions in any city worldwide — powered by AG2's `AGUIStream` over the AG-UI protocol and rendered with CopilotKit's chat UI.

<Callout type="info">
  CopilotKit consumes AG-UI protocol events streamed by AG2 over <code>/chat</code>. See the <a href="https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/user-guide/ag-ui/" target="_blank">AG2 AG-UI integration docs</a>.
</Callout>

## AG2 Bootstrap Template

If you prefer a generated starter instead of cloning the repo, use the CopilotKit bootstrap template and select **AG2** during setup. This wires up an AG2 backend over AG-UI and a ready-to-run frontend.

```bash
npx copilotkit@latest init
```

Follow the prompts to pick AG2 and the features you want, then run the install/start commands it prints.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

- **Python 3.10–3.13** for running the AG2 backend
- <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/" target="_blank">uv</a> (for Python dependency management)
- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download" target="_blank">Node.js</a> 18.18.0 or newer (specifically: ^18.18.0 || ^19.8.0 || >= 20.0.0)
- <a href="https://pnpm.io/installation" target="_blank">pnpm</a> (for frontend package management)
- <a href="https://platform.openai.com/api-keys" target="_blank">OpenAI API key</a>

## Getting started

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Clone the AG2 Samples Repository

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2-samples.git
        cd ag2-samples
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Set Up the AG2 Backend

        #### Install the dependencies:

        ```bash
        uv sync
        ```

        #### Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY`:

        ```sh
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
        ```

        #### Launch the AG2 weather agent:

        ```bash
        uv run python weather.py
        ```
        The backend server will start at http://localhost:8000 and serve the agent at `/weather`.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Set Up the CopilotKit UI
        
        The last step is to use CopilotKit's UI components to render the chat interaction with your agent.

        In a new terminal:

        ```bash
        cd ui
        pnpm install
        pnpm dev
        ```

        The frontend application will start at http://localhost:3000.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### 🎉 Talk to your agent!

        Congrats! You've successfully integrated an AG2 Agent chatbot into your application. Try asking a few questions:

        ```
        What's the weather in London?
        ```

        ```
        Weather in Tokyo
        ```

        ```
        What's the weather here?
        ```

        <Callout type="info">
            Asking "What's the weather here?" will use your browser's location if you allow it. If location access is denied, the agent will ask you for a city name instead.
        </Callout>
    </Step>

</Steps>

## What's next?

You've now got a Weather Agent running with CopilotKit! This demonstrates how quickly you can build practical AI applications by combining AG2's `AGUIStream` with CopilotKit's user interface components.
