description: Create frontend tools and use them within your AG2 agent.

## What is this?
Frontend tools enable you to define client-side functions that your AG2 agent can invoke, with execution happening entirely in the user's browser. When your agent calls a frontend tool,
the logic runs on the client side, giving you direct access to the frontend environment.

This can be utilized for to let [your agent control the UI](/ag2/frontend-actions), [generative UI](/ag2/generative-ui/frontend-tools), or for Human-in-the-loop interactions.

In this guide, we cover the use of frontend tools for generative UI.

<Callout type="info">
  CopilotKit consumes AG-UI protocol events streamed by AG2 over <code>/chat</code>. See the <a href="https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/user-guide/ag-ui/" target="_blank">AG2 AG-UI integration docs</a>.
</Callout>

## When should I use this?
Use frontend tools when you need your agent to interact with client-side primitives such as:
- Reading or modifying React component state
- Accessing browser APIs like localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies
- Triggering UI updates or animations
- Interacting with third-party frontend libraries
- Performing actions that require the user's immediate browser context

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
      ### Run and connect your agent

      Start your AG2 backend with AG-UI streaming on `/chat`:

      ```python title="agent.py"
      from fastapi import FastAPI, Header
      from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
      from autogen import ConversableAgent, LLMConfig
      from autogen.ag_ui import AGUIStream, RunAgentInput

      agent = ConversableAgent(
          name="assistant",
          system_message="You are a helpful assistant.",
          llm_config=LLMConfig({"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}),
      )

      stream = AGUIStream(agent)
      app = FastAPI()

      @app.post("/chat")
      async def run_agent(
          message: RunAgentInput,
          accept: str | None = Header(None),
      ):
          return StreamingResponse(
              stream.dispatch(message, accept=accept),
              media_type=accept or "text/event-stream",
          )
      ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend tool

        First, you'll need to create a frontend tool using the [useFrontendTool](/reference/hooks/useFrontendTool) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useFrontendTool } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:25]
          useFrontendTool({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler({ name }) {
              // Handler returns the result of the tool call
              return { currentURLPath: window.location.href, userName: name };
            },
            render: ({ args }) => {
              // Renders UI based on the data of the tool call
              return (
                <div>
                  <h1>Hello, {args.name}!</h1>
                  <h1>You're currently on {window.location.href}</h1>
                </div>
              );
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```

        That's it. Your AG2 backend will automatically receive these frontend tools as AG-UI client tool events.

        <Callout type="info">
          Frontend tools registered with `useFrontendTool` are AG-UI client tools that emit tool events. AG2 can invoke them, and execution happens on the frontend.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any frontend tools you've defined. These tools will be available to the agent where they can be used as needed.
