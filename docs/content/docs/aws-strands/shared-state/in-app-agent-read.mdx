## What is this?

You can easily use the realtime agent state not only in the chat UI, but also in the native application UX.

## When should I use this?

You can use this when you want to provide the user with feedback about your agent's state. As your agent's
state updates, you can reflect these updates natively in your application.

## Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Run and connect your agent
    <RunAndConnect components={props.components} />
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Setup your agent with state

    Define your agent's state schema. AWS Strands maintains state throughout execution.

    ```python title="agent/my_agent.py"
    from strands import Agent
    from typing import TypedDict

    # 1. Define the agent state schema
    class AgentState(TypedDict):
        language: str  # "english" or "spanish"

    # 2. Create the agent with state
    agent = Agent(
        name="languageAgent",
        description="Always communicate in the preferred language of the user as defined in the state",
        state_schema=AgentState,
        initial_state={"language": "english"},
        instructions="Always communicate in the preferred language of the user as defined in your state. Do not communicate in any other language."
    )
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Use the `useCoAgent` Hook

    With your agent connected and running, call the [useCoAgent](/reference/hooks/useCoAgent) hook, pass the agent's name, and
    optionally provide an initial state.

    ```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
    import { useCoAgent } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]

    // Define the agent state type to match your Strands agent
    type AgentState = {
      language: "english" | "spanish";
    };

    function YourMainContent() {
      // [!code highlight:5]
      const { state } = useCoAgent<AgentState>({
        name: "languageAgent",
        // optionally provide a type-safe initial state
        initialState: { language: "spanish" }
      });

      // ...

      return (
        // style excluded for brevity
        <div>
          <h1>Your main content</h1>
          {/* [!code highlight:1] */}
          <p>Language: {state.language}</p>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```
    <Callout type="info">
      The `state` in `useCoAgent` is reactive and will automatically update when the agent state changes.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Give it a try!

    As the agent state updates, your `state` variable will automatically update with it! In this case, you'll see the
    language set to "spanish" as that's the initial state we set.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Rendering agent state in the chat

You can also render the agent state in the chat UI. This is useful for informing the user about the state in a
more in-context way. To do this, you can use the [useCoAgentStateRender](/reference/hooks/useCoAgentStateRender) hook.

```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
import { useCoAgentStateRender } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]

// Define the agent state type, should match the actual state of your agent
type AgentState = {
  language: "english" | "spanish";
}

function YourMainContent() {
  // ...
  // [!code highlight:7]
  useCoAgentStateRender({
    name: "languageAgent",
    render: ({ state }) => {
      if (!state.language) return null;
      return <div>Language: {state.language}</div>;
    },
  });
  // ...
}
```
