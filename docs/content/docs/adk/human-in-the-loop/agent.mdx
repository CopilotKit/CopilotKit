## What is this?

ADK agents are are stateful agents that can use tool calls to request user confirmation or input.

CopilotKit lets you to add custom UI to take user input and then pass it back to the agent upon completion.

## Why should I use this?

Human-in-the-loop is a powerful way to implement complex workflows that are production ready. By having a human in the loop,
you can ensure that the agent is always making the right decisions and ultimately is being steered in the right direction.

ADK agents are a great way to implement HITL for more complex workflows where you want to ensure the agent is aware
of everything that has happened during a HITL interaction.

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Run and connect your agent

        You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding. If you haven't done so already,
        you can follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](/adk/quickstart/adk) guide.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Add a `useCopilotAction` to your Frontend
        First, we'll create a component that renders the agent's essay draft and waits for user approval.

        ```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
        import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core"
        import { Markdown } from "@copilotkit/react-ui"

        function YourMainContent() {
          useCopilotAction({
            name: "write_essay",
            available: "enabled",
            description: "Writes an essay and takes the draft as an argument.",
            parameters: [
              { name: "draft", type: "string", description: "The draft of the essay", required: true },
            ],
            renderAndWaitForResponse: ({ args, respond, status }) => {
              return (
                <div>
                  <Markdown content={args.draft || 'Preparing your draft...'} />
                  <div className={`flex gap-4 pt-4 ${status !== "executing" ? "hidden" : ""}`}>
                    <button
                      onClick={() => respond?.({ accepted: false })}
                      disabled={status !== "executing"}
                      className="border p-2 rounded-xl w-full"
                    >
                      Reject Draft
                    </button>
                    <button
                      onClick={() => respond?.({ accepted: true })}
                      disabled={status !== "executing"}
                      className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded-xl w-full"
                    >
                      Approve Draft
                    </button>
                  </div>
                </div>
              );
            }
          });

          return (
            <div>
              ...
            </div>
          );
        }
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Setup the ADK Agent
Now we'll setup the ADK agent. The flow is hard to understand without a complete example, so below
    is the complete implementation of the agent with explanations.

    Some main things to note:
    - The agent's state inherits from `CopilotKitState` to bring in the CopilotKit actions.
    - CopilotKit's actions are bound to the model as tools.
    - If the `writeEssay` action is found in the model's response, the agent will pass control back to the frontend
      to get user feedback.

            You are a human-in-the-loop essay writing assistant that helps write essays with human oversight and approval.

            **Your Primary Role:**
            - Generate short ~100 word esssay drafts for any topic the user requests.
            - Facilitate human review and modification of generated draft
            - When a human approves a draft, return it as text.

            **When a user asks you to write an essay:**
            - ALWAYS come up with a short (roughly 100 word) draft of an essay on the topic.
            - ALWAYS submit the draft to the `write_essay` tool.
            - When the user requests the essay, do not respond with the essay directly before it is approved. Always use the write_essay tool.

            ** PROVIDING THE APPROVED ESSAY TO THE USER: **
            - When the user approves the essay, *ALWAYS* respond with "HERE IS THE ESSAY: <essay>".
            - When the user rejects the essay, *ALWAYS* respond with "REJECTED".

        ### Give it a try!
        Try asking your agent to write an essay about the benefits of AI. You'll see that it will generate an essay,
        stream the progress and eventually ask you to review it.
