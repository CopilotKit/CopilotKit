## What is this?

Tools are a way for the LLM to call predefined, typically, deterministic functions. CopilotKit allows you to render these tools in the UI
as a custom component, which we call **Generative UI**.

## When should I use this?

Rendering tools in the UI is useful when you want to provide the user with feedback about what your agent is doing, specifically
when your agent is calling tools. CopilotKit allows you to fully customize how these tools are rendered in the chat.

## Implementation

<Steps>
<Step>
### Run and connect your agent

You'll need to run your agent and connect it to CopilotKit before proceeding. If you haven't done so already,
you can follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](/adk/quickstart/adk) guide.
</Step>
<Step>
### Give your agent a tool to call

<Tabs groupId="language" items={['Python']} default="Python">
    <Tab value="Python">
        ```python title="agent/sample_agent/agent.py"
        import uvicorn
        from fastapi import FastAPI
        from ag_ui_adk import ADKAgent, add_adk_fastapi_endpoint
        from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent

        def get_weather(location: str = 'the entire world') -> str:
            """Get the weather in a given location.

            Args:
                location: The location to get the weather for.

            Returns:
                the weather in the specified location.
            """
            return "it is sunny in " + location

        weather_agent = LlmAgent(
          model='gemini-2.5-flash',
          name="weather_agent",
          instruction=f"""
              You are an expert weather analyzer that can tell the current weather in a specific location.
              Use the get_weather tool to get the weather in a specific location. If the user doesn't specify
              a location, use "the entire world" as the location.
              """
        )

        adk_agent_weather = ADKAgent(
          adk_agent=weather_agent,
          app_name="weather_demo",
          user_id="demo_user"
        )

        # Create FastAPI app
        app = FastAPI(title="ADK Middleware Weather Tool Agent")

        # Add the ADK endpoint
        add_adk_fastapi_endpoint(app, adk_agent_weather, path="/")

        uvicorn.run(app, host="localhost", port=8000)
        ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>
</Step>
<Step>
### Render the tool call in your frontend
At this point, your agent will be able to call the `get_weather` tool. Now
we just need to add a `useCopilotAction` hook to render the tool call in
the UI.

<Callout type="info" title="Important">
  In order to render a tool call in the UI, the name of the action must match
  the name of the tool.
</Callout>

```tsx title="app/page.tsx"
import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core"; // [!code highlight]
// ...

const YourMainContent = () => {
  // ...
  // [!code highlight:13]
  useCopilotAction({
    name: "get_weather",
    available: "fronted", // Mark this as render only
    render: ({ status, args }) => {
      return (
        <p className="text-gray-500 mt-2">
          {status !== "complete" && "Calling weather API..."}
          {status === "complete" &&
            `Called the weather API for ${args.location}.`}
        </p>
      );
    },
  });
  // ...
};
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Give it a try!

Try asking the agent to get the weather for a location. You should see the custom UI component that we added
render the tool call and display the arguments that were passed to the tool.
