## What is this?
Frontend tools enable you to define client-side functions that your ADK agent can invoke, with execution happening entirely in the user's browser. When your agent calls a frontend tool,
the logic runs on the client side, giving you direct access to the frontend environment.

This can be utilized for to let [your agent control the UI](/adk/frontend-actions), [generative UI](/adk/generative-ui/frontend-tools), or for Human-in-the-loop interactions.

In this guide, we cover the use of frontend tools driving and interacting with the UI.

## When should I use this?
Use frontend tools when you need your agent to interact with client-side primitives such as:
- Reading or modifying React component state
- Accessing browser APIs like localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies
- Triggering UI updates or animations
- Interacting with third-party frontend libraries
- Performing actions that require the user's immediate browser context

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Run and connect your agent
       <RunAndConnect components={props.components} />
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend tool

        First, you'll need to create a frontend tool using the [useFrontendTool](/reference/hooks/useFrontendTool) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useFrontendTool } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:15]
          useFrontendTool({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler: async ({ name }) => {
              alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ###  Modify your agent
        Now, we'll need to modify the agent to access these frontend tools. Open up your agent's folder and continue from there!
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Setup your ADK Agent

        ADK automatically picks up frontend tools when you create your agent. No special configuration or state inheritance is needed:

        <Tabs groupId="language_adk_agent" items={['Python']} default="Python" persist>
            <Tab value="Python">
                ```python title="agent.py"
                from fastapi import FastAPI
                from ag_ui_adk import ADKAgent, add_adk_fastapi_endpoint
                from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent

                sample_agent = LlmAgent(
                    name="assistant",
                    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
                    instruction="""
                    You are a helpful assistant. Help users by answering their questions and assisting with their needs.
                    """
                )

                # Create ADK middleware agent instance
                adk_agent = ADKAgent(
                    adk_agent=sample_agent,
                    app_name="demo_app",
                    user_id="demo_user",
                    session_timeout_seconds=3600,
                    use_in_memory_services=True
                )

                # Create FastAPI app
                app = FastAPI(title="ADK Middleware Sample Agent")

                # Add the ADK endpoint
                add_adk_fastapi_endpoint(app, adk_agent, path="/")
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        That's it! Your agent will automatically have access to all frontend tools you've defined using `useFrontendTool` in your React components.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any frontend tools you've defined. These tools will be available to the agent where they can be used as needed.
