## What is this?

Frontend actions are powerful tools that allow your AI agents to directly interact with and update your application's user interface. Think of them as bridges that connect your agent's decision-making capabilities with your frontend's interactive elements.

## When should I use this?

Frontend actions are essential when you want to create truly interactive AI applications where your agent needs to:

- Dynamically update UI elements
- Trigger frontend animations or transitions
- Show alerts or notifications
- Modify application state
- Handle user interactions programmatically

Without frontend actions, agents are limited to just processing and returning data. By implementing frontend actions, you can create rich, interactive experiences where your agent actively drives the user interface.

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Setup CopilotKit

        To use frontend actions, you'll need to setup CopilotKit first. For the sake of brevity, we won't cover it here.

        Check out our [getting started guide](/adk/quickstart/adk) and come back here when you're setup!
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend action

        First, you'll need to create a frontend action using the [useCopilotAction](/reference/hooks/useCopilotAction) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:16]
          useCopilotAction({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            available: "remote", // optional, makes it so the action is *only* available to the agent
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler: async ({ name }) => {
              alert(`Hello, ${name}!`);
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ###  Modify your agent
        Now, we'll need to modify the agent to access these frontend actions. Open up for your agent's folder and continue from there!
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Setup your ADK Agent

        ADK automatically picks up frontend actions when you create your agent. No special configuration or state inheritance is needed:

        <Tabs groupId="language" items={['Python']} default="Python">
            <Tab value="Python">
                ```python title="agent-py/sample_agent/agent.py"
                from fastapi import FastAPI
                from ag_ui_adk import ADKAgent, add_adk_fastapi_endpoint
                from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent

                sample_agent = LlmAgent(
                    name="assistant",
                    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
                    instruction="""
                    You are a helpful assistant. Help users by answering their questions and assisting with their needs.
                    """
                )

                # Create ADK middleware agent instance
                adk_agent_sample = ADKAgent(
                    adk_agent=sample_agent,
                    app_name="demo_app",
                    user_id="demo_user",
                    session_timeout_seconds=3600,
                    use_in_memory_services=True
                )

                # Create FastAPI app
                app = FastAPI(title="ADK Middleware Sample Agent")

                # Add the ADK endpoint
                add_adk_fastapi_endpoint(app, adk_agent_sample, path="/")
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        That's it! Your agent will automatically have access to all frontend actions you've defined using `useCopilotAction` in your React components.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any CopilotActions you've defined. These actions will be available as tools to the agent where they can be used as needed.
    </Step>
