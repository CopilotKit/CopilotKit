title: Shared State
description: CoAgents maintain a shared state across your UI and agent execution.
---

CoAgents maintain a shared state that seamlessly connects your UI with the agent's execution. This shared state system allows you to:

- Display the agent's current progress and intermediate results
- Update the agent's state through UI interactions
- React to state changes in real-time across your application

The foundation of this system is built on ADK's stateful architecture. ADK Agents maintain their
internal state throughout execution, which you can access via the `useCoAgentState` hook.
