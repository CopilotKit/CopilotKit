## What is this?
Frontend tools enable you to define client-side functions that your CrewAI Flow agent can invoke, with execution happening entirely in the user's browser. When your agent calls a frontend tool,
the logic runs on the client side, giving you direct access to the frontend environment.

This can be utilized to let [your agent control the UI](/crewai-flows/frontend-actions), [generative UI](/crewai-flows/generative-ui/frontend-tools), or for Human-in-the-loop interactions.

In this guide, we cover the use of frontend tools for generative UI.

## When should I use this?
Use frontend tools when you need your agent to interact with client-side primitives such as:
- Reading or modifying React component state
- Accessing browser APIs like localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies
- Triggering UI updates or animations
- Interacting with third-party frontend libraries
- Performing actions that require the user's immediate browser context

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Run and connect your agent
        <RunAndConnect components={props.components} />
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Create a frontend tool

        First, you'll need to create a frontend tool using the [useFrontendTool](/reference/hooks/useFrontendTool) hook. Here's a simple one to get you started
        that says hello to the user.

        ```tsx title="page.tsx"
        import { useFrontendTool } from "@copilotkit/react-core" // [!code highlight]

        export function Page() {
          // ...

          // [!code highlight:25]
          useFrontendTool({
            name: "sayHello",
            description: "Say hello to the user",
            parameters: [
              {
                name: "name",
                type: "string",
                description: "The name of the user to say hello to",
                required: true,
              },
            ],
            handler({ name }) {
              // Handler returns the result of the tool call
              return { currentURLPath: window.location.href, userName: name };
            },
            render: ({ args }) => {
              // Renders UI based on the data of the tool call
              return (
                <div>
                  <h1>Hello, {args.name}!</h1>
                  <h1>You're currently on {window.location.href}</h1>
                </div>
              );
            },
          });

          // ...
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Modify your agent
        Now, we'll need to modify the agent to access these frontend actions. Open up your agent's folder and continue from there!
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Install the CopilotKit SDK
        <InstallSDKSnippet components={props.components}/>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Inheriting from CopilotKitState

        To access the frontend tools provided by CopilotKit, you can inherit from CopilotKitState in your agent's state definition:

        <Tabs groupId="language_crewai-flows_agent" items={['Python']} default="Python" persist>
            <Tab value="Python">
                ```python title="agent/sample_agent/agent.py"
                from copilotkit import CopilotKitState # [!code highlight]

                class YourAgentState(CopilotKitState): # [!code highlight]
                    your_additional_properties: str
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        By doing this, your agent's state will include the `copilotkit` property, which contains the frontend tools that can be accessed and invoked.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Accessing Frontend Tools

        Once your agent's state includes the `copilotkit` property, you can access the frontend tools and utilize them within your agent's logic.

        Here's how you can call a frontend tool from your agent:

        <Tabs groupId="language_crewai-flows_agent" items={['Python']} default="Python" persist>
            <Tab value="Python">
                ```python title="agent/sample_agent/agent.py"
                from crewai.flow.flow import start
                from litellm import completion
                from copilotkit.crewai import copilotkit_stream

                @start
                async def chat(self):
                    # Access the tools from the copilotkit property
                    tools = self.state.get("copilotkit", {}).get("actions", []) # [!code highlight]

                    response = await copilotkit_stream(
                        completion(
                            model="openai/gpt-4o",
                            messages=[
                                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                                *self.state.get("messages", [])
                            ],
                            tools=tools, # [!code highlight]
                            stream=True
                        )
                    )

                    # ...
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>

        These tools are automatically populated by CopilotKit and are compatible with LiteLLM's tool call definitions, making it straightforward to integrate them into your agent's workflow.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        You've now given your agent the ability to directly call any frontend tools you've defined. These tools will be available to the agent where they can be used as needed.
