## What is this?

A CrewAI Flow's state updates discontinuosly; only across function transitions in the flow.
But even a _single function_ in the flow often takes many seconds to run and contain sub-steps of interest to the user.

**Agent-native applications** reflect to the end-user what the agent is doing **as continuously possible.**

CopilotKit enables this through its concept of **_predictive state updates_**.


## When should I use this?
You can use this when you want to provide the user with feedback about what your agent is doing, specifically to:

- **Keep users engaged** by avoiding long loading indicators
- **Build trust** by demonstrating what the agent is working on
- Enable **agent steering** - allowing users to course-correct the agent if needed

## Important Note

When a function in your CrewAI flow finishes executing, **its returned state becomes the single source of truth**. 
While intermediate state updates are great for real-time feedback, any changes you want to persist must be explicitly 
included in the function's final returned state. Otherwise, they will be overwritten when the function completes.


## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Install the CopilotKit SDK
        <InstallSDKSnippet components={props.components}/>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Define the state
        We'll be defining a `observed_steps` field in the state, which will be updated as the agent writes different sections of the report.

                For long-running tasks, you can emit state updates progressively as predictions of the final state. In this example, we simulate a long-running task by executing a series of steps with a one second delay between each update.

                For long-running tasks, you can configure CopilotKit to automatically predict state updates when specific tool calls are made. In this example, we'll configure CopilotKit to predict state updates whenever the LLM calls the step progress tool.

        ### Observe the predictions
        These predictions will be emitted as the agent runs, allowing you to track its progress before the final state is determined.

        ```tsx title="ui/app/page.tsx"
        import { useCoAgent, useCoAgentStateRender } from '@copilotkit/react-core';

        // ...
        
        const YourMainContent = () => {
            // Get access to both predicted and final states
            const { state } = useCoAgent({ name: "sample_agent" });

            // Add a state renderer to observe predictions
            useCoAgentStateRender({
                name: "sample_agent",
                render: ({ state }) => {
                    if (!state.observed_steps?.length) return null;
                    return (
                        <div>
                            <h3>Current Progress:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                {state.observed_steps.map((step, i) => (
                                    <li key={i}>{step}</li>
                                ))}
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    );
                },
            });

            return (
                <div>
                    <h1>Agent Progress</h1>
                    {state.observed_steps?.length > 0 && (
                        <div>
                            <h3>Final Steps:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                {state.observed_steps.map((step, i) => (
                                    <li key={i}>{step}</li>
                                ))}
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    )}
                </div>
            )
        }
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        Now you'll notice that the state predictions are emitted as the agent makes progress, giving you insight into its work before the final state is determined.
        You can apply this pattern to any long-running task in your agent.
