## What is shared state?

CoAgents maintain a shared state that seamlessly connects your UI with the agent's execution. This shared state system allows you to:
- Display the agent's current progress and intermediate results
- Update the agent's state through UI interactions
- React to state changes in real-time across your application

The foundation of this system is built on CrewAI's stateful architecture.

## When should I use this?
State streaming is perfect when you want to facilitate collaboration between your agent and the user. Any state that your CrewAI Flow
persists will be automatically shared by the UI. Similarly, any state that the user updates in the UI will be automatically reflected

This allows for a consistent experience where both the agent and the user are on the same page.
