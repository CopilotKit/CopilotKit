  To learn about how to load previous messages and agent states, check out the

  and [Loading Agent State](/crewai-flows/persistence/loading-agent-state)
  pages.

To persist CrewAI Flow messages to a database, you can use the `@persist` decorator.

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, start, listen, persist

@persist  # Using SQLiteFlowPersistence by default
class MyFlow(Flow[MyState]):
    @start()
    def initialize_flow(self):
        # This method will automatically have its state persisted
        self.state.counter = 1
        print("Initialized flow. State ID:", self.state.id)

    @listen(initialize_flow)
    def next_step(self):
        # The state (including self.state.id) is automatically reloaded
        self.state.counter += 1
        print("Flow state is persisted. Counter:", self.state.counter)
```
