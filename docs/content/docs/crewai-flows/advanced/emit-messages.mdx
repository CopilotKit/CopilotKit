While most agent interactions happen automatically through shared state updates as the agent runs, you can also **manually send messages from within your agent code** to provide immediate feedback to users.

## What is this?

In CrewAI, messages are only emitted when a function is completed. CopilotKit allows you to manually emit messages
in the middle of a function's execution to provide immediate feedback to the user.

## When should I use this?

Manually emitted messages are great for **when you don't want to wait for the function** to complete **and you**:
- Have a long running task that you want to provide feedback on
- Want to provide a status update to the user
- Want to provide a warning or error message

## Implementation

<Steps>
    <Step>
        ### Run and Connect Your Agent to CopilotKit
        <RunAndConnectSnippet />
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Install the CopilotKit SDK
        <InstallSDKSnippet components={props.components}/>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Manually emit a message
        The `copilotkit_emit_message` method allows you to emit messages early in a functions's execution to communicate status updates to the user. This is particularly useful for long running tasks.

                ```python
                from litellm import completion
                from crewai.flow.flow import start
                from copilotkit.crewai import copilotkit_emit_message # [!code highlight]
                # ...

                @start()
                async def start(self):
                    # [!code highlight:3]
                    intermediate_message = "Thinking really hard..."
                    await copilotkit_emit_message(intermediate_message)

                    # simulate a long running task
                    await asyncio.sleep(2) 

                    response = copilotkit_stream(
                        completion(
                            model="openai/gpt-4o",

                                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                                *self.state["messages"]
                            ],
                            stream=True
                        )
                    )
                     message = response.choices[0]["message"]

                    self.state["messages"].append(message)
                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        ### Give it a try!
        Now when you talk to your agent you'll notice that it immediately responds with the message "Thinking really hard..."
        before giving you a response 2 seconds later.
