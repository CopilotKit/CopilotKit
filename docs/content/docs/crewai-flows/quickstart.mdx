## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have a [CrewAI Flow](https://docs.crewai.com/guides/flows/first-flow) deployed on [CrewAI Enterprise](https://docs.crewai.com/enterprise/introduction). If you're looking for a sample flows, check out this [example agentic chat implementation](https://github.com/suhasdeshpande/agentic_chat).

## Getting started

<Steps>
<TailoredContent
    className="step"
    id="path"
    header={
        <div>
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold">How do you want to get started?</p>
            <p className="text-base">
                Bootstrap with the new <span className="text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-400">CopilotKit CLI (Beta)</span> or code along with us to get started.
            </p>
        </div>
    }
>
    <TailoredContentOption
        id="cli"
        title="Use the CopilotKit CLI (NextJS only)"
        description="I have a Next.js application and want to get started quickly."
        icon={<SquareTerminal />}
    >
        <Step>
            ### Run the CLI
            Just run this following command in your Next.js application to get started!

            <Accordions>
                <Accordion title="Don't have a Next.js application?">
                    No problem! Just use `create-next-app` to make one quickly.
                    ```bash
                    npx create-next-app@latest
                    ```
                </Accordion>
            </Accordions>

            ```bash
            npx copilotkit@latest init -m CrewAI --crew-type Flows
            ```
        </Step>
        <Step>
            ### ðŸŽ‰ Talk to your agent!

            Congrats! You've successfully integrated a CrewAI Flow agent chatbot to your application. Depending on the
            template you chose, you may see some different UI elements. To start, try asking a few questions to your agent.

            ```
            Can you tell me a joke?
            ```

            ```
            Can you help me understand AI?
            ```

            ```
            What do you think about React?
            ```
        </Step>
    </TailoredContentOption>
    <TailoredContentOption
        id="code-along"
        title="Code along"
        description="I want to deeply understand what's happening under the hood or don't have a Next.js application."
        icon={<SquareChartGantt />}
    >
        <Step>
            ### Connect to Copilot Cloud
            1. Go to [Copilot Cloud](https://cloud.copilotkit.ai), sign in and click Get Started
            2. Click "Add Remote Endpoint" and fill in the details of your CrewAI Flow. Note: If your Agent Name contains multiple words, use underscores (`_`) as separators.
            3. Click "Save Endpoint"
            4. Copy the Copilot Cloud Public API Key

            <img src="/images/copilot-cloud/crewai-flow-cpk-setup.gif" alt="CrewAI Flow Copilot Setup" className="rounded-lg shadow-xl mt-4" />
        </Step>

        <Step>
            ### Install CopilotKit
            First, install the latest packages for CopilotKit into your frontend.
            ```package-install
            npm install @copilotkit/react-ui @copilotkit/react-core
            ```
        </Step>

        <Step>
            ### Setup the CopilotKit Provider
            The [`<CopilotKit>`](/reference/components/CopilotKit) component must wrap the Copilot-aware parts of your application. For most use-cases,
            it's appropriate to wrap the CopilotKit provider around the entire app, e.g. in your layout.tsx.

            <CloudCopilotKitProvider components={props.components} />

            <Callout type="info">
                Looking for a way to run multiple CrewAI Flows? Check out our [Multi-Agent](/crewai-flows/multi-agent-flows) guide.
            </Callout>
        </Step>
        <Step>
            ### Choose a Copilot UI
            You are almost there! Now it's time to setup your Copilot UI.
            <CopilotUI components={props.components} />
        </Step>
        <Step>
            ### Create a CrewAI Flow component
            Place the following snippet in your **main page** (e.g. `page.tsx` in Next.js) or wherever you want to use CopilotKit.

            ```tsx title="page.tsx"
            "use client";
            import "@copilotkit/react-ui/styles.css";
            import { CopilotKit, useCopilotAction } from "@copilotkit/react-core";
            import { CopilotChat } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
            import React, { useState } from "react";

            const publicApiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COPILOT_API_KEY || "";
            /**
             * AgentName refers to the Crew Flow Agent you have saved via CLI during setup.
             * It is used to identify the agent you want to use for the chat.
             */
            const agentName =
              process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_COPILOTKIT_AGENT_NAME || "DefaultAgent";

            // Main Chat Component: Handles chat interface and background customization
            const Chat = () => {
              const [background, setBackground] = useState(
                "linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)"
              );

              // Action: Allow AI to change background color dynamically
              useCopilotAction({
                name: "change_background",
                description:
                  "Change the background color of the chat. Can be anything that the CSS background attribute accepts. Regular colors, linear of radial gradients etc.",
                parameters: [
                  {
                    name: "background",
                    type: "string",
                    description: "The background. Prefer gradients.",
                  },
                ],
                handler: ({ background }) => setBackground(background),
                followUp: false,
              });

              return (
                <div
                  className="h-screen w-full flex items-center justify-center"
                  style={{ background }}

                          placeholder: "Type a message...",
                        }}
                      />
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
              );
            }

            // App Component: Main wrapper that provides CopilotKit context
            const CrewAIFlow: React.FC = () => (
              <CopilotKit publicApiKey={publicApiKey} agent={agentName}>
                <Chat />
              </CopilotKit>
            );

            export default CrewAIFlow;
