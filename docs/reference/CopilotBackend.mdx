<RequestExample>
  ```jsx CopilotKitBackend Example
  import { 
    CopilotBackend, 
    OpenAIAdapter 
  } from "@copilotkit/backend";

  export async function POST(req: Request) {
    const copilotKit = new CopilotBackend();
    return copilotKit.response(req, new OpenAIAdapter());
  }
```
</RequestExample>

This class is the main entry point for the backend. It handles requests from the frontend, provides function calling and various LLM backends.

Currently, you can use `OpenAIAdapter` for direct access to the OpenAI API and `LangChainAdapter` to use the LangChain API as a backend.

## OpenAIAdapter

Simply pass an instance of `OpenAIAdapter` to the `response` method of `CopilotBackend` to use OpenAI as a backend.

```typescript
const copilotKit = new CopilotBackend();
return copilotKit.response(req, new OpenAIAdapter());
```

## LangChainAdapter

To use LangChain as a backend, provide a handler function to the adapter with your custom LangChain logic.
The async handler function can return:
- a simple `string` response
- a LangChain stream `IterableReadableStream`
- a LangChain `BaseMessageChunk` object
- a LangChain `AIMessage` object

This example streams back OpenAI messages via LangChain:
```typescript
return copilotKit.response(
  req,
  new LangChainAdapter(async (forwardedProps) => {
    const model = new ChatOpenAI(
      { modelName: "gpt-4-1106-preview" }
    );
    return model.stream(
      forwardedProps.messages, 
      { tools: forwardedProps.tools }
    );
  }),
);
```

## Server Side Actions

CopilotKit supports actions that can be executed on the server side. You can define server side actions by passing the `actions` parameter:

```typescript
const copilotKit = new CopilotBackend({
  actions: [
    {
      name: "sayHello",
      description: "Says hello to someone.",
      argumentAnnotations: [
        {
          name: "arg",
          type: "string",
          description: "The name of the person to say hello to.",
          required: true,
        },
      ],
      implementation: async (arg) => {
        console.log("Hello from the server", arg, "!");
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Server side actions can also return a result which becomes part of the message history.

This is useful because it gives the LLM context about what happened on the server side. In addition,
it can be used to look up information from a vector or relational database and other sources.

In addition to that, server side actions can also come from LangChain, including support for streaming responses.

Returned results can be of the following type:
- anything serializable to JSON
- `string`
- LangChain types:
  - `IterableReadableStream`
  - `BaseMessageChunk`
  - `AIMessage`

## LangServe

The backend also supports LangServe, enabling you to connect to existing chains, for example python based chains.
Use the `langserve` parameter to specify URLs for LangServe.

```typescript
const copilotKit = new CopilotBackend({
  langserve: [
    {
      chainUrl: "http://my-langserve.chain",
      name: "performResearch",
      description: "Performs research on a given topic.",
    }
  ],
});
```

When left out, arguments are automatically inferred from the schema provided by LangServe.
