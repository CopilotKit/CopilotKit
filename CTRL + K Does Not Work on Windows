Describe the bug
On Mac, cmd + k opens a popover in <CopilotTextarea>, but on Windows, ctrl + k does not trigger the same behavior. This issue may occur in other areas where keyboard shortcuts are used.

To Reproduce

1.Use a Windows machine.
2.Go to CRM Demo.
3.Focus on the textarea field.
4.Press ctrl + kâ€”nothing happens.

Expected Behavior
Popover should open as it does with cmd + k on Mac.

Potential Solution
Consider using a cross-platform keyboard shortcut library to handle key mapping differences in React/JS.
