# CopilotKit <> PydanticAI Starter

This is a starter template for building AI agents using [PydanticAI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) and [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai). It provides a modern Next.js application with an integrated investment analyst agent that can research stocks, analyze market data, and provide investment insights.

## Prerequisites

- OpenAI API Key (for the PydanticAI agent)
- Python 3.12+
- uv
- Node.js 20+
- Any of the following package managers:
  - npm (default)
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  - [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
  - [bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm (default)
npm install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using bun
bun install
```

> **Note:** This will automatically setup the Python environment as well.
>
> If you have manual issues, you can run:
>
> ```sh
> npm run install:agent
> ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:

Create a `.env` file inside the `agent` folder with the following content:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-openai-key-here...
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
# Using npm (default)
npm run dev

# Using pnpm
pnpm dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev

# Using bun
bun run dev
```

This will start both the UI and agent servers concurrently.

## Available Scripts

The following scripts can also be run using your preferred package manager:

- `dev` - Starts both UI and agent servers in development mode
- `dev:debug` - Starts development servers with debug logging enabled
- `dev:ui` - Starts only the Next.js UI server
- `dev:agent` - Starts only the PydanticAI agent server
- `build` - Builds the Next.js application for production
- `start` - Starts the production server
- `install:agent` - Installs Python dependencies for the agent

## Documentation

The main UI component is in `src/app/page.tsx`. You can:

- Modify the theme colors and styling
- Add new frontend actions
- Customize the CopilotKit sidebar appearance

2. Your OpenAI API key is set correctly
3. Both servers started successfully

### Python Dependencies

If you encounter Python import errors:

```bash
cd agent
uv sync
uv run src/main.py
```
