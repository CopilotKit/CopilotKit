# CopilotKit <> Agno Starter

This is a starter template for building AI agents using [Agno](https://agno.com) and [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai). It provides a modern Next.js application with an integrated investment analyst agent that can research stocks, analyze market data, and provide investment insights.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)
- OpenAI API Key (for the Agno agent)
- Any of the following package managers:
  - npm (default)
  - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  - [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
  - [bun](https://bun.sh/)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm (default)
npm install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using bun
bun install
```

> **Note:** Installing the package dependencies will also install the agent's python dependencies via the `install:agent` script.

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

or create a `.env` file.

```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here" > .env
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
# Using npm (default)
npm run dev

# Using pnpm
pnpm dev

# Using yarn
yarn dev

# Using bun
bun run dev
```

This will start both the UI and agent servers concurrently.

## Available Scripts

The following scripts can also be run using your preferred package manager:

- `dev` - Starts both UI and agent servers in development mode
- `dev:ui` - Starts only the Next.js UI server
- `dev:agent` - Starts only the Agno agent server
- `build` - Builds the Next.js application for production
- `start` - Starts the production server
- `install:agent` - Installs Python dependencies for the agent

## 📚 Documentation

The main UI component is in `src/app/page.tsx`. You can:

- Modify the theme colors and styling
- Add new frontend actions
- Customize the CopilotKit sidebar appearance

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Connection Issues

If you see "I'm having trouble connecting to my tools", make sure:

1. The Agno agent is running on port 8000
2. Your OpenAI API key is set correctly
3. Both servers started successfully

### Python Dependencies

If you encounter Python import errors:

```bash
cd agent
uv sync
```
