    agenticChat: `This is the simplest chat agent.

It can be built with CopilotKit's headless UI, or with CopilotKit's customizable pre-built components.

This agent also supports frontend tool calls: try to ask it to 'Set the background to a pink-yellow gradient'.`,

    humanInTheLoop: `This agent demonstrates human-in-the-loop (HITL). Ask it to do anything (e.g. 'Go to mars') and it will respond with a checklist plan that the user can edit and comment on.

HITL support is fully open-ended: the input & output of the HITL interaction are both generic JSON objects, and the rendered UI is a fully custom react component. HITL is supported both inside the chat and outside the chat. Check useLangGraphInterrupt(...) hook for details.

Go ahead and try it out! e.g. say 'go to mars!'.`,

    agenticGenerativeUI: `This agent demonstrates agentic generative UI: rendering of the agent's state. Ask it to perform some task ('Go to mars') and it will simulate going through the motions of the task.

Agentic generative UI is useful both to keep users engaged during agent execution, and to allow for agent-steering (allow users to bring the agent back on track if it goes down the wrong path).

Agentic generative UI is fully open-ended: simply return any custom react component as it runs. Check the useCoAgentStateRender(...) hook for details..`,

    toolCallingGenerativeUI: `This agent demonstrates tool-calling generative UI. Ask it to 'Generate a haiku about AI'

Agentic generative UI is fully open-ended, and  seamlessly supports in-chat and outside-chat experiences. See useCopilotAction(...) for details.`,

    sharedState: `This example demonstrates shared state between the agent and the application. Shared state binds the frontend and the agent into a single coherent system: Whatever changes the agent makes to its internal state, are reflected in the application state, and vice-versa.

Try to ask it for some recipe, e.g. 'Create a recipe for a spicy pasta dish.', and watch as the state updates. You can then modify the state manually, and chat with the agent to observe it 'sees' your edits.`,

    predictiveStateUpdates : `This agent demonstrates predictive state updates: updates of the agent state prior to execution end. Ask the agent to tell you a short story about pirates - then accept its suggestions. Then ask it to change the pirate's name to George and see what happens.`
