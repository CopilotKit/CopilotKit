# üìù Predictive State Updates Document Editor

## What This Demo Shows

This demo showcases CopilotKit's **predictive state updates** for real-time document collaboration:
1. **Live Document Editing**: Watch as your Copilot makes changes to a document in real-time
2. **Diff Visualization**: See exactly what's being changed as it happens
3. **Streaming Updates**: Changes are displayed character-by-character as the Copilot works

## How to Interact

Try these interactions with the collaborative document editor:
- "Fix the grammar and typos in this document"
- "Make this text more professional"
- "Add a section about [topic]"
- "Summarize this content in bullet points"
- "Change the tone to be more casual"

Watch as the Copilot processes your request and edits the document in real-time right before your eyes.

## ‚ú® Predictive State Updates in Action

**What's happening technically:**
- The document state is shared between your UI and the Copilot
- As the Copilot generates content, changes are streamed to the UI
- Each modification is visualized with additions and deletions
- The UI renders these changes progressively, without waiting for completion
- All edits are tracked and displayed in a visually intuitive way

**What you'll see in this demo:**
- Text changes are highlighted in different colors (green for additions, red for deletions)
- The document updates character-by-character, creating a typing-like effect
- You can see the Copilot's thought process as it refines the content
- The final document seamlessly incorporates all changes
- The experience feels collaborative, as if someone is editing alongside you

This pattern of real-time collaborative editing with diff visualization is perfect for document editors, code review tools, content creation platforms, or any application where users benefit from seeing exactly how content is being transformed!
