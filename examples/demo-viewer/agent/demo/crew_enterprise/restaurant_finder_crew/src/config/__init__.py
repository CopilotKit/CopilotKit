# This file is required to make the directory a Python package.
# By including an __init__.py file, Python treats the directory as a package,
# allowing you to import modules from this directory.
# This file can be empty, or it can execute initialization code for the package.
# In this case, it is left empty as a placeholder to signify the directory as a package.
