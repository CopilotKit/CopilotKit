        CopilotKit provides several key components for your applications:
        
        1. CopilotSidebar: A collapsible sidebar component that provides an AI chat interface. Implement it with:
           <CopilotSidebar instructions="Your instructions here" />
        
        2. CopilotChat: A customizable chat interface for AI interactions. Use it with:
           <CopilotChat instructions="Your instructions here" />
        
        3. CopilotTextarea: An enhanced textarea with AI-powered autocompletion:
           <CopilotTextarea placeholder="Type here..." />
        
        4. CopilotContext: Wrap your application with this provider to enable global access to CopilotKit features:
           <CopilotContext>
             <YourApp />
           </CopilotContext>
        
        5. CopilotPopover: A floating AI assistant that can be triggered from any part of your application.

    content: `
        When troubleshooting CopilotKit implementations, follow these steps:
        
        1. Check API Configuration: Ensure your OpenAI or Anthropic API keys are correctly set in your environment variables.
        
        2. Verify SDK Integration: Confirm that your React app properly imports and uses CopilotKit components and hooks.
        
        3. Inspect Console Logs: Check your browser or server console for error messages that might indicate configuration issues.
        
        4. Component Setup: Verify that CopilotKit components have proper instructions and configuration props.
        
        5. Actions and Context: Ensure that any CopilotActions or context providers are correctly implemented with proper typings.
        
        6. Version Compatibility: Make sure you're using compatible versions of all CopilotKit packages.
        
        7. Server-Side Setup: If using server components, verify your API routes are correctly configured.
        
        8. Streaming Responses: For issues with streaming, check that your API endpoints support streaming responses.
