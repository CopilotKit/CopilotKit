# Personal Finance Copilot

> A conversational, multi-currency personal-finance tracker for React Native — log expenses, set budgets, and open accounts by **chatting** or by **snapping a receipt photo**, with **every write approved by a human in chat** before it touches the books. Built on [CopilotKit](https://copilotkit.ai) + a vision-capable LLM runtime.

This is a **multi-currency personal finance tracker** built as a **CopilotKit React Native showcase**: the AI doesn't just answer questions about your money — it **proposes structured writes** (transactions, budgets, accounts) that you approve inline, and it **renders rich generative UI in chat** (lists, progress bars, ranked tables, a real SVG donut chart) instead of flat text.

---

## In-chat generative UI

The chat doesn't reply with paragraphs of numbers — it commissions the right surface for the question. Real screenshots from the iPhone simulator, all driven by live `gpt-5.4-2026-03-05` calls through the CopilotKit AG-UI runtime:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="docs/screenshots/chat-donut.png" alt='"where did my money go this month" → SVG donut chart' width="240" /><br />
      <sub><i>"where did my money go this month"</i> → SVG donut chart</sub>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="docs/screenshots/chat-accounts.png" alt='"show me my balances" → AccountsResultCard' width="240" /><br />
      <sub><i>"show me my balances"</i> → multi-currency list card</sub>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="docs/screenshots/chat-hitl-card.png" alt='HITL approval card with full transaction details' width="240" /><br />
      <sub><i>"I spent $12.50 on coffee at Blue Bottle paid with Checking"</i> → HITL approval card</sub>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="docs/screenshots/chat-hitl-resolved.png" alt="Add expense / Edit / Cancel buttons" width="240" /><br />
      <sub>Approve / Edit / Cancel — every write is human-confirmed</sub>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

A 47-second [walkthrough video](docs/videos/demo.mp4) (3.9 MB) drives the full flow end-to-end on the iPhone 17 simulator. Reproduce locally with `maestro test .maestro/readme-demo.yaml` after starting the runtime + Metro.

## What you can do

**Conversational writes** — every one of these proposes a card in chat that you Approve / Edit / Cancel:

- _"I spent $12.50 on coffee at Blue Bottle this morning, paid with Checking"_ → an `Add expense` approval card
- _"Open a EUR savings account called Travel Fund with €2,000"_ → a `Create account` approval card
- _"Cap my groceries budget at $500 a month"_ → a `Save budget` approval card
- _"Bump my dining budget to $400"_ → an `Apply` card showing the **before → after** diff

On approval, the card resolves in place — _Add expense_, for instance, confirms the account's **new balance** right inside the card.

**Generative UI grounded reads** — the agent commissions rich cards instead of describing data in text:

- _"What did I spend this month by category?"_ → an **SVG donut chart** with a per-slice legend (the headline "controlled graph in chat" moment)
- _"What were my biggest expenses?"_ → a **ranked table** (#, expense, amount), biggest first
- _"How am I doing on budgets?"_ → per-category rows with **spent / limit** amounts and over-budget tinting
- _"Show me my recent activity"_ → a list of transaction rows with category emojis and signed amounts
- _"What are my balances?"_ → balance pills, one per account, each in its native currency

**Receipt photos** — attach a receipt with the 📎 button, the runtime's vision model extracts merchant / amount / currency / date / category, the chat renders a **receipt-preview card with a thumbnail**, and the agent then proposes the transaction behind a HITL approval.

**Quick-start chips & reset** — the empty chat surfaces tappable **starter prompts** (_"Where did my money go this month?"_, _"Show me my balances"_, …); **follow-up chips** (_"Break it down by category"_, _"What were my biggest expenses?"_, …) sit at the bottom of an active conversation; and a **New chat** button in the header clears the thread.

## Quickstart

You need a Mac with Xcode, Node 22+, Ruby (for CocoaPods), an iOS simulator, and an OpenAI API key.

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit.git
cd CopilotKit/examples/showcases/react-native-personal-finance
npm install
cd ios && bundle install && bundle exec pod install && cd ..

# 2. Set up the runtime
cd runtime
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# → edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…
npm run dev           # CopilotKit runtime on http://localhost:3000
cd ..

# 3. Run the app (separate terminal)
npm start             # Metro bundler on :8081
npm run ios           # builds + launches on the iOS simulator
```

On a **physical device**, change `RUNTIME_BASE` in `App.tsx` to your machine's LAN IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.42:3000`) so the device can reach the runtime.

---

## Try these prompts

Once the app is running on the simulator with the runtime alive, tap the **🤖 Assistant** tab and try any of these. Each is wired to a different generative-UI surface — together they show off every CopilotKit primitive in the build.

### Generative UI — the agent commissions a card

| Prompt                                    | What renders                                               | Tool                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| _"Where did my money go this month?"_     | **SVG donut chart** with per-category legend, % and total  | `getSpendByCategory`    |
| _"What were my biggest expenses?"_        | **Ranked table** (#, expense, amount), biggest first       | `getTopExpenses`        |
| _"Show me my balances"_                   | Account list with currency-aware balances                  | `getAccounts`           |
| _"How am I doing on budgets this month?"_ | Per-category rows with spent / limit + over-budget tinting | `getBudgets`            |
| _"What did I spend recently?"_            | Transaction rows with emojis, accounts, signed amounts     | `getRecentTransactions` |

### Human-in-the-loop writes — Approve / Edit / Cancel cards

| Prompt                                                              | What renders                                      | Tool             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| _"I spent $12.50 on coffee at Blue Bottle, paid with Checking"_     | `Add expense` HITL card                           | `addTransaction` |
| _"Add a €40 dinner at Trattoria Napoli to Travel Fund yesterday"_   | Same card, EUR + dated                            | `addTransaction` |
| _"Open a savings account called Emergency Fund in USD with $1,000"_ | `Create account` HITL card                        | `createAccount`  |
| _"Cap my dining budget at $300 a month"_                            | `Save budget` HITL card                           | `setBudget`      |
| _"Bump groceries to $500"_                                          | `Apply` HITL card showing **before → after diff** | `editBudget`     |

### Receipt photo

Tap the **📎** button in the chat input, attach a receipt photo (any image works for testing), and the agent will:

1. Show a **receipt-preview card** with the thumbnail + extracted fields
2. Propose an `addTransaction` HITL card with those fields pre-filled
3. Commit to your accounts when you tap Approve

### Composed flows

The agent can chain tools — try compound asks:

- _"What's my net worth, and how am I doing on budgets?"_ → two cards in one turn
- _"Add a $9 lunch on Amex, then show me Amex's balance"_ → write + read in one turn
- _"Cap dining at $300 and groceries at $500"_ → two HITL cards back-to-back

## Guided demo — a 5-act walkthrough

A narrative flow for showing the app off end to end — ideal for a recording or a live demo. Each line is a prompt to type in the **🤖 Assistant** tab; the acts build from grounded reads to multi-tool turns.

### Act 1 — Orient (grounded reads → generative UI, no walls of text)

- _"Show me my balances"_ → balance pills, incl. the **EUR** Travel Fund → sets up the multi-currency story.
- _"Where did my money go this month?"_ → the **SVG donut chart**. This is the headline "controlled graph in chat" moment — lead with energy here.
- _"What were my biggest expenses?"_ → a **ranked table** (#, expense, amount).
- _"How am I doing on budgets this month?"_ → per-category rows with **spent / limit** and over-budget tinting.

### Act 2 — Act on it (the "you propose, I approve" story)

- _"I spent $12.50 on coffee at Blue Bottle this morning, paid with Checking"_ → an **Add expense** approval card → tap **Approve** → the card resolves and confirms Checking's new balance inline.
- _"Bump my groceries budget to $700"_ → an **Apply** card showing the **before → after** diff ($600 → $700).
- _"Set a $150/month budget for Health"_ → a **Save budget** card (creates a _new_ budget — shows it's not just edits).

> **Point to make while demoing:** every write is gated by a human — nothing touches the books until you tap **Approve**.

### Act 3 — International / multi-currency

- _"Add a €40 dinner at Trattoria Napoli to Travel Fund yesterday"_ → same approval card, **EUR + a past date** — and notice it never silently converts currencies.
- _"Open a GBP savings account called London Flat with £3,000"_ → a **Create account** card in a third currency.

### Act 4 — Multimodal climax (the receipt)

Tap **📎**, attach any receipt photo → a **receipt-preview card** (thumbnail + extracted merchant / amount / currency / date / category) → the agent then proposes an **Add expense** card pre-filled from the photo → **Approve**.

### Act 5 — Agentic, multi-tool turns (the closer)

- _"What's my net worth, and how am I doing on budgets?"_ → two cards in one turn.
- _"Add a $9 lunch on Amex, then show me Amex's balance"_ → a write **and** a read chained in a single turn, ending on the updated balance.

```

The custom `ChatScreen` walks `copilotkit.renderToolCalls` (registered by `useHumanInTheLoop` / `useFrontendTool({render})`) — a different registry from the RN-local `useRenderTool` registry the prebuilt `<CopilotChat>` reads. Doing this manually is what lets HITL `respond(…)` round-trip through a custom chat.

---

## What's next

Open issues track the most-requested follow-ups:

- **Conversation threads** — persist + switch between chats (the **New chat** reset button and starter / follow-up chips have shipped)
- **Budget management** — edit / delete budgets from the UI (the richer per-category progress visualisation has shipped)
- **Persistence** — the in-memory Zustand store should survive reloads

See [Issues](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/issues).
