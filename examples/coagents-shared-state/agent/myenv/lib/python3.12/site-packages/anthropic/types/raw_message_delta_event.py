    """Billing and rate-limit usage.

    Anthropic's API bills and rate-limits by token counts, as tokens represent the
    underlying cost to our systems.

    Under the hood, the API transforms requests into a format suitable for the
    model. The model's output then goes through a parsing stage before becoming an
    API response. As a result, the token counts in `usage` will not match one-to-one
    with the exact visible content of an API request or response.

    For example, `output_tokens` will be non-zero, even for an empty string response
    from Claude.
