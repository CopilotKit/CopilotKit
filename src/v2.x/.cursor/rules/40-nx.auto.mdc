- Tasks are inferred from package.json scripts. Target defaults (dependsOn, cache, inputs, outputs) are configured in `nx.json`.
- Use `nx run <project>:<target>` for single-project tasks.
- Use `nx run-many -t <target>` for workspace-wide tasks.
- Avoid adding new targetDefaults without discussion.
