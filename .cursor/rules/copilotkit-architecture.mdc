# CopilotKit Architecture Overview

## Core Library Structure
The main CopilotKit library is located in [CopilotKit/](mdc:src/v1.x/) with the following key packages:

### React Packages
- **[react-core/](mdc:src/v1.x/packages/react-core/)** - Core React components and hooks for CopilotKit
- **[react-textarea/](mdc:src/v1.x/packages/react-textarea/)** - Textarea component with AI integration
- **[react-ui/](mdc:src/v1.x/packages/react-ui/)** - UI components for copilot interfaces

### Runtime & SDK
- **[runtime/](mdc:src/v1.x/packages/runtime/)** - Core runtime for executing copilot actions
- **[runtime-client-gql/](mdc:src/v1.x/packages/runtime-client-gql/)** - GraphQL client for runtime communication
- **[sdk-js/](mdc:src/v1.x/packages/sdk-js/)** - JavaScript SDK for backend integration
- **[shared/](mdc:src/v1.x/packages/shared/)** - Shared utilities and types

### Python SDK
- **[sdk-python/](mdc:sdk-python/)** - Python SDK with integrations for:
  - CrewAI agents in [crewai/](mdc:sdk-python/copilotkit/crewai/)
  - LangGraph integrations
  - OpenAI integrations in [openai/](mdc:sdk-python/copilotkit/openai/)

## Key Concepts
- **Copilots**: AI assistants that can read and write application state
- **Actions**: Functions that copilots can call to interact with your application
- **Agents**: Backend AI agents that process complex tasks
- **Coagents**: Multi-agent systems for complex workflows

## Examples Structure
All examples are in [examples/](mdc:examples/) and typically follow this pattern:
- `agent/` or `agent-py/` - Backend agent implementation
- `ui/` - Frontend Next.js application
- `README.md` - Setup and usage instructions

## Development Workflow
- Examples use the local packages via workspace references
- [package.json](mdc:src/v1.x/package.json) contains workspace configuration
- Scripts in [scripts/](mdc:src/v1.x/scripts/) for development, testing, and releases
